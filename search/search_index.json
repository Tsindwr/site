An individual, a regal one at that, has a craving. We do not need to know who this individual is, just that they are royalty and therefore are accustomed to receiving that which they request, and that which they are requesting is an apple. </p> <p>\"Bring me an apple! I must have one at once!\"</p> <p>The regent waits, not for an uncomfortable amount of time. The regent is particular, but is aware of the expected amount of time that must pass before the regent's request may be fulfilled. After this not uncomfortable amount of time passes, a subject presents the regent with an item.</p> <p>\"An apple for you, high regent, as you requested.\"</p> <p>Presenting it in a white linen wrapping, the subject displays in their hands a round, red fruit, with a rounded hexagonal form and a crown-like growth where it was plucked by the stem. Presented in a white linen wrapping before the high regent, who had requested an apple, is a plump pomegranate.</p> <p>\"What is the meaning of this? I had requested an apple! Not some bitter excuse of an approximation of one...\"</p> <p>...is how you might have expected this interaction to proceed. But, as storytellers, we can blur the lines between truth and falsehood, yes and no, right and wrong. And we do this by adding dimensions of truth. Consider: if ALL of the facts of the world were placed on a straight line, where the coordinate of a fact represented one unique statement, and each had a value of either \"true\" or \"false.\" </p> <p>If we found the coordinate point for \"The regent requested an apple\" in the context of this story, its statement value would be \"true,\" because we have established it to be just so. We have also established \"The subject brought the regent a pomegranate\" to be true. Now, in the world as we know it, if we traveled further down the line, the phrase \"The regent is satisfied with the knowledge that his request has been fulfilled\" would be marked as false. But this is assuming that what we've been trained to know still applies.</p> <p>At some point, \"A pomegranate is not an apple\" has been deemed as true. But what if it also wasn't? What if \"A pomegranate is not an apple\" could also be false? But narrator, then we would have two contradicting truth values for the same point on our line! Correct! Which is where we propose that truth has dimension. It is possible for truth to also be falsehood, as long as the proper dimensions and context are built around it. The only time two dots share a coordinate on a line yet have two different values is when there is an underlying umpteenth dimension that would give them separate identities.</p> <p>Before we make this sound too complicated, thankfully this story has a simple solution. The term \"apple,\" at its origin of use, was not used to solely refer to the fruit that comes from the tree known as Malus domestica, or whichever cousin of the apple tree existed at the time of the creation of the word \"apple.\" \"Apple\" was used to refer to ALL fruits, and slowly after some linguistic prototype mumbo jumbo and a really long period of civilizational social development yadda yadda, \"apple\" evolved to refer to the fruit it evokes in your mind today. So, giving this story a linguistic dimension and flexibility to consider that a word you understand today may not mean what you think it means (just ask Inigo Montoya), we can end our short story with:</p> <p>\"This is much appreciated, dear subject. If you would be so kind as to bring me my paring knife?\"</p> <p>As storytellers, we must become experts in holding contradictive truths simultaneously. This may be easier said than done, though fictional genres like fantasy and science fiction would not have been able to be developed without this technique: they tell of protagonists who make possible the impossible, they describe incomprehensible horrors who only pose a threat when witnessed and comprehended, and they speak of the unreal made real. </p> <p>Take for example the following hypothetical facts:</p> <ol> <li>\"I killed them.\"</li> <li>\"I saved their life.\"</li> </ol> <p>While keeping the Agent and Theme constant (the actor and \"actee\", per se), there are several ways to add dimensions of truth to make these contradicting phrases simultaneously hold true.</p> <p>We could, for example, add some specificity. Maybe the definition of \"kill\" in this circumstance, was entirely technical. A doctor who saves a patient during open-heart surgery must stop the heart and use a bypass machine. If one's definition of \"killing\" included stopping their heart, this may allow these two phrases to be true simultaneously.</p> <p>We could instead add a dimension of relative time. One could feasibly save someone's life, and then also kill the same person. However, is it possible to switch the time relation? Perhaps the previous example could be stretched to be considered killing someone and then saving their life immediately afterwards, but narratively the two actions were part of the same process. We begin to see how fictional genres are born when we start to stretch the boundaries of our own understandings of the world. For one to kill another person through one act or process, and then save their life after some time has passed, we need to create a dimension of truth of our own. The power to bring back the long dead, though impossible in our world, is precisely the product of the practice we are proposing for transcendent fantasy storytelling: nothing is impossible so long as you extrapolate farther for new dimensions of truth.</p>"},{"location":"#an-entire-worlds-truth","title":"An Entire World's Truth","text":"<p>Umbrea is not the world you'll be playing in. This preface is just a fancy way of preparing you for this fact. This world is a convergence of truths, where the pivotal contradictions were given new dimensions of truth to reach an equilibrium. \"Umbrea\" is just one of the two superimposed existences that now exist within the same dimensional sphere in the cosmos.</p> <p>In the broad strokes of things, Umbrea exists within a larger cosmos, whose essence comprises the space between stars, the supposedly insurmountable space between different existences. These existences reside in places called spheres: spheres of influence, spheres of truth; these spheres contain within them a unique set of rules and defined truths that its contents must follow. Because of this, the setting of Umbrea is inclusive to other campaign settings that may not exactly follow the lore of the main campaign setting detailed in this guide.</p> <p>In our sphere, the planet of Tsindwr (/'sin-dur/) is circled by a set of twelve moons of varying sizes, orbits, and compositions. Without a local sun to light the land of Umbrea, these moons and their backdrop of stars are the best way for scholars to keep track of the days and passing time.</p> <p>These moons are some of the last remaining proof of the existence of the gods. Some say they first came to Tsindwr on these moons, some believe they built them when they arrived as their personal domains, and some suspect that the moons are the corpses of the dead gods themselves. What we do know of our world's first visitors, can be found in the mythos of an ancient elven civilization who later left Tsindwr to travel the stars.</p> <p>The astral elves, or Shimylv, were the first to settle Tsindwr. What has been recovered of their history has either been restored from artistic reliefs, inferred from their arcane artifacts, or passed through word of mouth by their descendants. Their advancement in the mystic arts and astromancy suggests the possibility of other records of their civilization, though these methods of storing histories have yet to be discovered or decoded.</p> <p>Their more base methods of records were oft reserved for their mythology, which is why we have record of the gods' few stories. This includes the events leading to their downfall: the conclusion to a war between the Divines and the Primordials. Originating from the adjacent planes of elemental chaos, the Primordials wanted Tsindwr for themselves: a playground of their destruction and constant rebirth. The Divines had other plans: a world of creation and evolution, something new to be perceived and discovered by its inhabitants.</p> <p>However, a group of the Divines wanted to explore their destructive capabilities alongside the Primordials, and thus the Pantheon was split in two. Though a trickster god called Nlyoz-a, or The Light, knew a way to resolve this conflict, though at no one's benefit in particular. She had overheard Tbedw-na, or The Spider, speak of a ritual that could empower Tsindwr with the Divine souls, protecting it from further encroachment from the Primordials. Confident in her ability to finish the ritual, Nlyoz-a snuck into Tbedw-na's domain and stole the ritual texts.</p> <p>The ritual required the cooperation of all of the Divines, and great sacrifice too, so Nlyoz-a devised a ruse. She added a clause to the ritual's final revision, and told both the Divines of Creation and the Divines of Destruction that this clause would protect them from the sacrifice needed by the ritual. Consulting with both groups at once, Nlyoz-a coordinated the ritual to be conducted contemporaneously from opposite sides of the world. What the rest of the Divines did not know, was that Nlyoz-a was conducting a third ritual, the final clause, in another location, and meant to only spare herself from the toll required by Tbedw-na's magic. She only intended to have Tsindwr for herself for a few decades before releasing her siblings, but her clause was flawed, and she ultimately needed to join her brethren in sacrifice to stabilize the final spell. In the end, all souls of the Divine were separated from their avatars, and imbued within the land of the Material Plane, imbuing it with a newfound planar boundary more stable and protective.</p> <p>Scholars theorize that the gods now imbue the latent planar permanence of nature and its forces, though some theorize that they slumber in ancient tombs, dispersing their divine influence in radial areas around them. Skeptics are convinced they have been dead for a long time, and there's no use in waiting for their return.</p>"},{"location":"#elfin-legacy","title":"Elfin Legacy","text":"<p>The Shimylv were the first to harness the dichotomic essences of Gloam and Faerie that permeate the world of Tsindwr. In most other spheres, the planes of the Feywild and the Shadowfell have been separated from the primary or Material Plane, however this is always done through the will of the gods. In Tsindwr, where the Divines are absent, the Material Plane still has its brightest and darkest aspects, giving its environment a polarizing and diverse level of magical infusion. Because of this, it is common for the innate nature of the land to imbue the living with consciousness and the dead with life. Much like the Feywild, one's environment can be influenced by one's mood, and much like the Shadowfell, the environment itself can influence its inhabitant's emotions. This made the land of Umbrea very volatile, and nearly uninhabitable, until the Shimylv introduced the Obelisks.</p> <p>Great stone pillars with tapered tops were inscribed with constellations of arcane sigils and names, anchoring the nature of its surroundings to become stable enough to hold a single form, a single identity. The Shimylv were the first mortals to assign True Names to the land, quite literally setting them in stone to allow for stationary settlements and safe throughways. Without them, Umbrea was a roiling mass of whim and terror, where incorporeal presences haunted every shadow and mesmerizing swirls of enchanting spirits led wandering souls to their eternal entrapment.</p> <p>For the most part, the evidence of the astral elves and their mystically-advanced civilization lives on in ancient abandoned cities carved of a singular stone structure. None have yet been able to reproduce the grandeur of their architecture, but there are those that search their ruins for enlightenment. Many of the names taken by large cities and assigned to major land formations are also influenced by the psychic presence of the True Names assigned to them by the Shimylv, though the passing of time has allowed them to shift and evolve with language. The last chapter of Shimylv civilization that we know of is their encounter with an intradimensional horror that leaked into Tsindwr, in the vast network of caves below the surface called the Kagecombs.</p> <p>The entity was only ever pictured as a kaleidoscope of blank eyes, writhing tendrils, and dendritic mineral growths. It was never named or recorded in writing, so we will refrain from doing so in this recounting. What we can tell you is that the remains of this defeated entity were what fed the mineral growths in the depths below, and created a unique resource to be studied and harnessed by an elfin outpost that later became the dominion of Sauztein Geb. After sundering this entity, the Shimylv seem to all have left this plane for the stars; very rarely do these elves return to Umbrea but it has been known to happen occasionally.</p>"},{"location":"#beneath-the-footfalls-of-titans","title":"Beneath the Footfalls of Titans","text":"<p>Millenia passed between the visitations of the Shimylv and the evolution of sentient anthropoid species, the first of which being the Mulburrows. The faerie essence of Tsindwr allowed for an advanced rate of evolution and change amongst its organic inhabitants, and was often influenced by the wills in its vicinity. This is likely why Mulburrows came to be during the Age of Titans. Lesser elementals from the Primordial Sea had found entryways into the Material Plane that were too small to allow Primordials to pass through but gave Titans such as giants and dragons a backdoor to explore a realm previously void of civilization. The presence of intelligent life was quite possibly the final piece required for the birth of the first unique race of Tsindwr.</p> <p>The Mulburrow people were brought into the world while the elemental Titans attempted to shape and colonize the land. These fleet-footed smallfolk became quickly accustomed to using the nature around them to create camouflaged and portable shelters; they were always on the move. They began relying on the innate magics of the flora and imitating the practices of the fauna around them, slowly discovering a pattern to their formation and rituals. The Mulburrow civilization was the first to diverge from elemental magics and construct artificial spellcraft, through mimicry of nature's knowledge. They called the practice Weaving, and today they have perfected the craft of sewing arcane sequences into apparel, carving enchantments into materials, and coaxing plants into braided wards.</p> <p>But it would be a long time before the Mulburrows could settle down in a haven of their own. Irachron was nigh and the elemental factions were on the brink of coups. In the beginning of the Titan's conquest of the Material Plane, each element found their own corner of the world. Giants and dragons of their respective factions lived in harmony for a period, building grand castles to house the planar crossings from where they came. Though over time, the essential Dichotomy of Tsindwr slowly sewed dissent between the two species; giants became obsessed with harnessing Gloam and dragons fell to Faerie's temptation to hoard the boons of the land. Both groups of Titans believed the other to be an obstacle to their goals; the giants would not part with their constructed keeps and dragons would not part with their understanding of the arcane. They were divided by their jealousy and ambition, thus beginning the Era of Rage and Storm: the Irachron.</p> <p>War between giants and dragons ensued, lesser elementals were summoned as infantry and colossi called Wardens were built as harbingers of destruction. Giants became pioneers in the harnessing of Gloam's mutational properties; the phenomenon of enhancing natural fauna into colossal beasts of rending and craze was called Seep: the moment when a creature accepts the influence of Gloam to overtake their physical form and transmute into something more. Dragons took the first steps into golemic magicks and material alchemy, creating semi-autonomous constructs of inanimate material made animate through arcane sigiling and element-powered movement: as the dragons discovered new materials and methods of transmutation, they were able to optimize the composition of these golems for specialized purposes.</p> <p>It was the discovery of Petrolune that turned the tides. Golems made from this material found in the ocean depths were observed to have unpredictable behavior, having disruptive and dampening interactions with arcane magic but would sometimes take unprompted autonomous action. Dragons who hoarded this material slowly became more and more seclusive, focusing on the understanding of this strange material. Petrolune golems seemed to learn, which was previously unheard of. Eventually, these golems started to go missing. Mulburrow legend, however, tells of voiceless visitors made of armor and barbs who showed no signs of life except for two glowing green eyes. These beings became historically known as The Heralds, and were the same beings that caused the end of the Era of Rage and Storm. Leading Mulburrow tribes across the world, these Heralds infiltrated giant strongholds and disrupted their protected portals, cutting them off from their elemental allies and leaving them vulnerable to the dragons' tyranny. The Mulburrows were essential for the downfall of the giants, providing the Heralds the necessary concealment and navigation through the strongholds, then slipping away unseen to leave the Heralds to complete the destruction of the portals.</p> <p>After the strongholds were stripped of their wealth by the dragons and giants were driven into exile, the Mulburrows inherited the empty ruins and built multi-leveled communities and shelters from artificially-enforced wooden structures with a heavy incorporation of natural materials and high degrees of craftsmanship. Today, these strongholds are little-known, partially due to their strategic placement in the landscape, but also partially due to the Mulburrows' expertise in Weaving: they've had more than enough time to imbue a misdirection enchantment around their borders to protect from feral monstrosities.</p>"},{"location":"#if-umbrea-were-a-single-state-drakonia-would-be-its-capitol","title":"If Umbrea were a single state, Drakonia would be its capitol.","text":"<p>The story of the Irachron coming to its end gave way to the beginning of the Gnosichron, the Era of Known History. This was an era of draconic reign, arcane innovation, and the birth of the first true civilizations. The Empir Drakoni, or Empire of Dragons, was a sovereignty that spanned the entire northern half of the continent of Umbrea, and its capitol, Drakonia, was an island province in the center of an inland sea.</p> <p>But 500 years before the end of the Era of Rage and Storm, the legacy of the Drakoni and its empire would begin in a single egg, shared by two brothers: Owalid and Oshik. Twin wyrms, they hatched to the warmth of their mother's hoard being melted down by the elemental glyphs of attacking giants. Bound by blood and fueled by revenge for their slain mother, Owalid and Oshik were the first of the dragon Titans to brush away their pride and work together. It was their final attack on the giants that drove home the nail that cemented the Gnosichron into stability. </p> <p>It was these brothers who established the first settlement of what would become the great Empir Drakoni. This was a haven to conscious reptilians of all sorts, including humanoid Faerfolk (awakened anthropomorphic beastfolk), as well as even a slow trickle of minor dragons who let go of their independence in favor of communal benefits. As the settlements grew, leading proud Titans such as dragons became an increasingly difficult group to manage, let alone lead. They needed direction, a common goal. So Owalid and Oshik decided to give them one.</p> <p>Drakkonia would become the greatest arcane hub of knowledge and innovation that Umbrea has ever seen. The pursuit of understanding the fabric of magic, The Arras, and the extrapolation of its patterns through implemented equation became the focus of dragonkin all over. Moving beyond golemic magic, the Empir Draconi became notorious for its infrastructural enchantments, the most notable being the aeropolises. The first aeropolis, or city of the sky, was made from the summit of the island's volcanic peak, rotated upside down and fueled by its elemental connection to the plane of fire. Later iterations of the aeropolises would no longer have such a reliance on the elemental planes, but Drakonia's sister city of Dwoemer's name would go on to represent all artificial arcane enchantments: a herald of esoteric accomplishment.</p>"},{"location":"#the-fall-of-an-empire","title":"The Fall of an Empire","text":"<p>The first public signs of civil restlessness arrived with the establishment of the Drakonic Arena. Gladiators throughout the realm were called upon to provide entertainment with the prospects of earning a place in Empir Draconi's high militia.

With little explanation to the reason behind his stepping down from the throne, there was now concerns about both the longevity of their rulers, as well as the question of their successors. </p> <p>There were many who believed the next line of emperors should be chosen, but there were many differing claims. The most notable candidate was a shimylf by the name of Valen Searcher, who dubbed himself The Sapphire King. A leader in his own right, The Sapphire King was the face of a large astral colony of elves and ingratiated himself to the Drakoni people through the Drakonic Arena. He rose through the ranks and graduated to a senior officer of the crown's guard. By then he had amassed a following and now had the numbers to challenge the throne.</p> <p>Disaster struck before reform could even take a breath. Valen Searcher, The Sapphire King, quickly pivoted to exodus by sea, speaking of a great calamity on the horizon. \"The sun would take a final breath and give way to an age of darkness and terror.\" Some believe his proximity to the emperor gave him insight to a dangerous arcane experiment whose repercussions would wrack the realm to its core. Some thought it was an attempt to bring his brother back from the dead. Some posited it was the last throes of a ruler desperate for ensured immortality. Some claimed it was not Valen, but his wife, only ever referred to as Nonna Rossa, who foretold the coming of a doomsday. </p> <p>Drakonia sunk into the bowels of the earth.

In fact, no evidence of its residents survived the fall of Empir Drakoni. What was left behind was a black sun that drained the heat of the entire north, leaving a frigid desert where the empire once stood proud.

While these archetypes may have specific associations with general TTRPG classes, there are always exceptions to each archetype: your playstyle is yours to choose and the narrative is yours to flavor your decision.</p> <p>Spellslingers specialize in offensive magic, whether it be from synthetic dwoemers, drawing from warp, or sourcing from an arcane entity. Many Wizards, Shamans, Sorcerers, and Warlocks fall under the spellslinger archetype.</p> <p>Summoners use magic to bring physical manifestations into Umbrea for both battle and everyday tasks. These adventurers augment their battlestyle with magic to bring physical attacks, sometimes even enhancing their own bodies. Many Artificers, Druids, Monks, and Mystics fall under the summoner archetype.</p> <p>Control archetype adventurers focus on orchestrating the actions and surroundings of others in battle. These characters can create widespread magical effects to alter the battlefield, make snap decisions to maneuver allies in the fray, or overpower the will of enemies and use their strength to the enchanter\u2019s advantage. Many Druids, Fighters, Mystics, and Wizards fall under the control archetype.</p> <p>Faces of the party excel in weaving words and reading people to anticipate and influence others\u2019 actions. They specialize in inspiring allies to find the confidence to succeed, analyzing the habits and fighting style of enemies to locate weaknesses, or charming their way into otherwise inaccessible corners of society. Many Bards, Monks, Rogues, and Warlocks fall under this archetype.</p> <p>Saboteurs are the shadows in the night and the knife in the dark. These are the sneak-thieves, the discreet watchers, and the cunning deliverers of impairment who may focus on catching enemies by surprise, creating new and innovative methods of incapacitating others, or obtaining magic for both concealment and sabotage. Many Artificers, Rangers, Rogues, and Sorcerers tend to fall into this archetype.</p> <p>Support characters are those who work best from the sidelines, both relying on their allies to reach their goal and being relied on to prop up said allies. These adventurers are notoriously versatile, and may focus anywhere between providing expertise in various skills and trades, presenting a knack for quick but minor battlefield triage, or even enhancing their allies with performance-based dwoemers. Artificers, Bards, Clerics, and Rogues tend to fall into this category.</p> <p>Frontliners are the daring adventurers who face their tasks head-on, often with heavy training or combat magic to assist them. To do so, these characters either train rigorously under a certain fighting style, unlock secret mystical potentials through deep meditation and discipline, or master fusing physical combat with simple arcane enchantments. Artificers, Fighters, Monks, and Rangers are often considered as part of this category.</p> <p>Halfcasters dip into both worlds: physical combat and spell-slinging alike. These adventurers are able to focus on spells that both enhance one\u2019s power and bolster one\u2019s well-being while also boasting expertise in weapons and physical activity. Halfcasters may pluck from other archetypes\u2019 specialties, such as a summoner-support-type who channels psionic energy for both protective barriers and restorative spells. Many Artificers, Mystics, Paladins, and Rangers fall under this category.</p> <p>Healers are the epitome of adventuring safety, and specialize in warding and restorative magicks. This can range from attuned channelers of nature who use the world\u2019s flow of life force to jumpstart a creature\u2019s healing, to researchers of the humanoid body that can utilize tools and salves to enhance one\u2019s performance, to unnatural wielders of alien magicks that can reanimate the dead and create strange prosthetics by combining limbs from other creatures. Healers can often present as Clerics, Druids, Warlocks, and Wizards.</p> <p>Tanks are the defensive line in any adventuring party: always happy to take a hit for their friends. Tanks come in many varieties: whether they are armor-laden bulwarks, steel-nerved berserkers, or biologically-enhanced beings of extraordinary absorptive constitution.

Those who followed this tradition are called Arcanists: those who would take advantage of the innate Essences of materials and other methods made to skip past the effort necessary to wield Names. </p> <p>The first of these Arcanists were the Mullburrows, who specifically pioneered the subtradition of Artifice. By using their understanding of the properties of the medicinal herbs and fauna of their environment and mimicking the structural patterns found in nature: they spun enchantments of protection, fertility, and luck using what they refer to as Gonjyue /go\u014b'd\u0292juwe/, roughly translating to \"Divine Geometry.\" Branching patterns of vine-like embroidery on a cotton blouse, carefully-wound crowns of dried flowers, and carved bone trinkets set into braided hair are some of the many examples of early dwoemercraft birthed by civilization. This particular form of early Artifice was intuitive; there were no defined protocols for constructing an enchantment: only the abstract application of correlations between natural properties and the enchantment's intention.</p> <p>The next advancements made in the Arcane came during the Drakkonic Era. Mages of the Empir Drakoni sought to elaborate on the fundamentals of elemental runes. Bringing the primal runes from the elemental planes from which the Giants and Dragons came, both Dragons and their citizens worked on developing a method of dwoemercraft called Inscription. The runes themselves carried with them a modicum of Warp from the elemental planes, but were a relatively docile source of energy to augment and repurpose into customized dwoemers. To do this, Mages elaborated on the physical carving of the runes, enduring many trials and errors to develop new alteration runes made to diffuse, bind, release, and extend the fundamental runes. The invention of an oil-based ink made with the remains of sea Titans allowed for more flexible dwoemercraft, creating the possibility for spells to be cast in the span of seconds through writing, as opposed to its previous limitation of etching-based application.</p> <p>After the fall of the Drakkonic Empire, arcane advancement was stripped of its formality and left in the hands of ambitious survivalists. These budding Mages turned to the wisdom of Hedges, who were those who negotiated the boundaries between the Material and Warp. Also called Hedge Mages, they spend their efforts understanding the distinctions between what is of this plane (considered Material) and what is leaking into this plane as Warp. These are not Arcanists but they made a lasting impact on the future Colleges' understanding of Essence; they will be elaborated upon in the next section. Right now, Hedges were the mentors of the wily surviving Mages of the Empir Draconi. These mentors would lead the next generation of Mages towards reconnecting with the root of Magick: the understanding of Essence and Names. This new generation of Mages were called Witches: those who used the ancestral knowledge of tradition to tap into Names instead of needing to meditate on their meaning themselves. This heavily relied on the fact that a culture's arts such as folklore, song, and poetry were capable of representing an Essence during one time, then also gathering new context and meaning as they are passed on through generations. Witches specialized in a spellcasting form called Chanting, which invokes the words of ancestral rites and song to channel Essence: much different from the practice of Inscription, which harnesses runes to pull from the meaning of symbols that represented the Names of fundamental forces of nature. This gives a Witch a baseline understanding of the Essences they are channeling, as well as the flexibility to use certain Chants for varying purposes.</p> <p>Modern Mages would elaborate further on the history of spellcasting by pulling from the several different methods created in the history of Umbrea. Wizards would combine Inscription and the lyrical content of Chanting to innovate the casting method of Scrivening, allowing Wizards to memorize phrases of ancient language and translating them into the magical pidgin of Glyph. This is a constructed language specifically used to translate spoken language into the representation of Runes. Glyph can be expressed as speech, writing, and manual signing, essentially creating new entry points for green Mages to learn relatively simple mediums for spellcasting. The many mediums of arcane expression allow for somatic spellcasting, spell scroll drafting, and the ease of indexing spells without casting them upon writing.</p> <p>The investigation of innate Essences found in materials was also pursued, pulling much inspiration from the first practitioners of Artifice from Mullburrow civilization. Modernized Scrivening opened the floodgates to further research, including the pursuit of Alchemy. Alchemists of the Luxichron Era would begin a flurry of classifications and ordering of Vis /vi/, which in Alchemy refers to a discrete property found in a given material. Alchemists describe the world as a collection of entities and phenomena composed of Vis. Since most of the theoretical presence of Vis comes in a composite form, Alchemy involves the unmaking and refining of materials to reach purity that can imitate an invocation of the Name of the relevant Vis.</p>"},{"location":"lore/arras/#wielders-of-the-name","title":"Wielders of the Name","text":"<p>Those who do take the meditative path of understanding the true nature of that which surrounds them are called Invokers. Since Names are intrinsically tied to the existence of a phenomenon, they are something that can be called upon at any moment, given an Invoker knows how exactly to call it to evoke their intention upon the world. Invocation is a finicky form of Magick, and can result in catastrophe under the wrong circumstances, but those who wield Names wield great power indeed.</p> <p>Those who did not live in the isolated communities of Mullburrows nor the advanced cities of the Drakkonic Empire lived in the wilds of Fellsaire, a world of surging magical storms, looming predators, and doom lurking around every corner. The first mystical protectors of the inhabitants of the wilderness were those who delegated between spirits and the living. Hedges acted as these wizened pillars of a community, drawing much of their spiritual understanding from the Obelisks of Shimylv. The large stone constructs left behind by the astral elves millennia ago held within them the enchantments that protected localized areas from the chaos of Faerie and Gloam; in fact, they are some of the root bindings between fundamental forces and their Names. By attuning to these Obelisks, Hedges were able to learn of the underlying potential of complete understanding towards their surrounding, realizing that channeling this command over the spirits around them can assist in diplomacy and the protection of their people. Hedges are now considered the bridge between spirits and the living as they live in a strained yet well-established harmony in settled areas.</p> <p>Once there was an established security in these settlements, Hedges became less common and instead there was a focus on harmonizing with the nature spirits of the area. These Invokers focused on the bolstering of living beings with the energy of their spiritual guardians, and these people were named Druids. Druids focus on the smaller spirits, which they respectfully refer to as gods. These are the spirits of individual creeks, cricketsong, and the soothing sensation of tea; they range far and wide and can be coaxed into assisting many a type of problem. Druids may come into a level of renown worthy of being granted audience to much older and potent spirits, though this is rare. Their connection to Names is a spiritual one: they seek to understand the world around them through reverence and acknowledgement that every little thing in this world has a Name and therefore a spirit attached to them, one that should be treated with as much consideration as the living.</p> <p>After the development of Witchcraft, there were those who grew attached to not just the lyrics of the Chants used in spellcraft, but also the melodies. These Bards would find that music is a medium capable of traversing time similarly to poetry and folklore, and opened the Invocational tradition to a world of art and interpretation. Bards subscribed to the philosophy that Essences are made of composite meanings, a collection of smaller parts, similarly to Alchemists, but Bards differ by acknowledging these atomic parts are difficult define by themselves, and can only be narrowed upon by calling upon more examples that represented that single idea. By using art as a medium, Bards were able to Invoke through interpretation; their spells by nature had many meanings, and drew from many Names at once, but that composite piece of spellcraft was something they could control instead of aspiring to control the individual Names with more precision. This process was simply called the Craft. Unlike many Invoker traditions, the Bards have constructed Colleges of their own, simulating the existing structure of higher education in Arcane traditions, except their teachings focus on mentoring under the creative trades, cultural history, as well as research and debate over artistic interpretation and meaning of existing masterpieces of Craft. Graduating members of these Colleges must first create a Craft of their own design or build upon an existing piece old enough to be considered endangered of becoming outdated, for the Craft only continues to work as long as the tradition is carried through the generations, and its words and melodies remain meaningful.</p> <p>As adventurers became more abundant in the world, the need for supporting those who had the power to change the world for the better became greater, and Invokers of all kinds strove to fill this role. Some radical minds believed that adventuring, being a catalyst for story, had the potential for a new source of Nomic intuition. These Invokers found that rather than trying to learn the Names of fundamental Essences, they could focus on observing the actions and stories of their companions and those that they faced. Pursuing the understanding of their companions' names allows Paladins to bolster their allies by reinforcing their Essence through deep connection and the understanding of a person's Name through the pursuit of such relationships. </p>"},{"location":"lore/arras/#harbingers-of-warp","title":"Harbingers of Warp","text":"<p>The act of manipulating extraplanar energies is akin to discovering you can breathe water; under normal circumstances it is a result of actions made under desperation, trying to rationalize it requires disconnection from what you once thought was real, every nerve in your body is telling you not to let the water in, and even after doing it once it will always be an alien sensation. Those who would wield the energies of Warp pull from their source in a practice called Channeling. </p> <p>One origin of Channelers comes from the phenomenon where living beings are exposed to the effects of Warp, and thereon carry with them a mote of that same energy within themselves. These Channelers are called Sorcerers and manifest their connection to extraplanar Magick from their physical form, which has been altered by the original exposure.</p> <p>Many others find themselves Channeling after imploring salvation during a time of crisis from a higher power. Those who respond to these pleas are often those searching for something in exchange: Fae who consume the True Names of living souls, Demons who feed upon the remaining sanity of their prey, and aberrant entities who collect disciples to do their bidding. Those who accept these deals with extraplanar beings are called Warlocks and when they accept these deals, their salvation often comes in the form of access to new power: a Warp whose nature corresponds to the plane of origin of this meddling entity. Since Warlocks are tied to their Patron, the inhuman natures of these entities have fouled the public opinion of Warlocks and their goals. This reputation, like any generalization, is contrasted by those who specifically implore the assistance of benevolent Patrons, or at least ones whose goals align with the protection of society. These Warlocks are referred to as Shamans, though they channel Warp in the same way; the populace simply created a distinguishing term between what they perceive as \"good\" or \"bad\".</p> <p>The more Warp is explored by Arcanists, the more they realize how little they know about its nature; continuous observation only proves to show that Warp behaves in ways incompatible to the preexisting frameworks Arcanists have made for spellcasting and the harnessing of Magick. However, some have been able to isolate existing Warp effects, similar to what they would normally refer to as an Enchantment if it were a permanent Magickal effect, then wrap it inside of a synthetic Binding. This Binding allows Mages to abstract the nature of the Warp and interact with it through the Arras. This creates an interface between Warp and the Arcane, though casting a Binding requires a loose mind, open to the informality of Warp. Once a Binding is cast, it acts as a translator of Magickal input and output; it can both be used to influence the Warp inside as well as synthetically channel the specific Warp's effects outside of the Binding. The practice of creating and using these Bindings is called Thaumaturgy.</p> <p>Some of the most incomprehensible Warp comes from what is called the Far Realm. Beings from this place communicate through thought in hive minds and exist as concepts, not physical forms. Those that attempt to comprehend the incomprehensible often rave with madness before ever achieving their goal. However, those who unravel the smallest insights into the malleability of reality as it is harbored in the Far Realm are able to wield a power called Psionics. One who wields this power is called a Psion, and these Psionar take distancing themselves from reality to an extreme. A simple thought of a Psion is enough to compel the Essences around them to bend to their will. Many scholars believe that this is not a form of Magick at all, and can only be described as a power that operates outside of the laws of the Arras: a power referred to as Mysticism.</p>"},{"location":"lore/arras/#a-lost-tradition","title":"A Lost Tradition","text":"<p>Scholars who dabble in Invocation and study the Arcane often posit that the creation of the Material Plane could not have been done through any method of Magick currently known to the Colleges. These philosophers suggest that, like Arcane Traditions are to the Arras, the Arras most likely is but one method of harnessing Magickal potential in the greater Cosmos. Meaning whoever shaped this world, assumedly the Old Pantheon, must have had distinct understandings of Magick and how to wield it, suggesting possibly that wherever in the Cosmos these gods' remains lie, there may be some evidence or records of a method of spellcasting new to this world, and immensely powerful, enough to create universes. This unknown Magick is referred to simply as Divinity.</p>"},{"location":"meta/bookmarks/","title":"Bookmarks","text":"Bookmarks <p>                 Your saved highlights from Sunder TTRPG.             </p>                  Press Enter to search              <p>Loading your bookmarks...</p>"},{"location":"meta/report-issue/","title":"Report an Issue","text":"<p> If you spot a typo, unclear rule, or anything broken, you can use this form to let The Archivist know. </p> Issue type Rules / mechanics Typos / wording Layout / navigation Other Page or section What seems wrong? <p>         Include enough detail for The Archivist to reproduce the issue.     </p> Optional contact          Send report      <p></p>"}]}
