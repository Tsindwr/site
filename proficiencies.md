# Proficiencies

## Skill Proficiencies

Proficiency in Skills can be achieved with class features, background features, and racial features. When proficient in a skill, a creature rolls 1 additional Volatility Die when making a D20 [[resolution-system|Test]] with that specific Skill.
## Knacks

A character may also be further experienced in an activity more specific than one of the 24 Skills. These are represented by Knacks, and allow players to add an additional Volatility Die for each Knack that is applicable to the current D20 Test. **Knacks** are unique subcategories of skills or subjects that a character specializes in. There is not a defined list of available Knacks in Sunder, but some examples may be: *acrobatics, Draconian history, horseback riding, or woodcarving.* 

If a Test has more than one Knack pertinent to its goal (e.g. determining the original purpose of a wood-carved statue from the Gnosichron era), then the player adds a Volatility Die to their Volatility Pool per Knack applicable to the Test.
## Domains

A third kind of proficiency involves **Domains**, which are broad subjects that define an adventurer's natural affinities towards certain actions or topics. There are thirteen domains, each corresponding to a deity of the pantheon:
