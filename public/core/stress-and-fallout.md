# Stress and Fallout
## Success Comes at a Price
###### Stress

**[[damage|Stress]]** affects not only the results of [[volatility-and-perks|Volatility Dice]], but also a creature's defensive capabilities. As the representation of the strain a creature has accumulated during gameplay, [[damage|Stress]] builds up in each of your [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] tracks and overflows if it exceeds the maximum value, so the more [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] a player has, the more defense they have against the setbacks of [[damage|Stress]]. 

The more [[damage|Stress]] a player accumulates, the more likely they are to fall to this strain. [[damage|Stress]] can come from enemies' attacks, or the call can come from inside the house:

1. Rolling a Success on a Test causes a player to take 1 [[damage|Stress]] in the relative [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential Track]].
2. Rolling a [[resolution-system|Crit]] on a Test does not cause any [[damage|Stress]], whether it is due to a [[volatility-and-perks|Volatility]] modification or a natural roll of the D20.

###### Fallout

**Fallout** is an accumulation of misfortune and heroic strain, providing an extra risk to initiating [[resolution-system|Tests]]. Fallout can be triggered in a few ways, including sources of damage and the rolling of [[resolution-system|Tests]]:

1. When a character would take [[damage|Stress]] in a [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential Track]] that does not contain enough free slots and would result in an overflow, this triggers Fallout.
2. If a character would spend a Resistance in a [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential Track]] that does not contain enough free slots and would result in an overflow, this triggers Severe Fallout as the character attempts to push past their own limits. Doing this grants [[resolution-system|Advantage]] on their next roll and allows them to gain a Beat.
3. Rolling a Mixed Success on a Test results in Narrative Fallout.
4. Rolling a Failure results in Situational Fallout.
5. Rolling a [[resolution-system|Miff]] results in one Fallout level higher than the default Situational Fallout.


>[!important] Recap!
>Here's a one-stop cheat sheet for Test [[resolution-system|success levels]] and their results:
>- *Natural Crit*: Regain a Resistance of your choice (best plausible outcome)
>- *Crit*: Take no Stress (best plausible outcome)
>- *Success*: Take 1 Stress (intended outcome)
>- *Mixed Success*: Narrative Fallout + 1 Beat (positive and negative outcome)
>- *Failure*: Situational Fallout + 1 Beat (negative outcome)
>- *Miff*: Increased Situational Fallout + 1 Beat (worst plausible outcome)
>- *Natural Miff*: Increased Situational Fallout + 1 Beat - 1 Resistance (worst plausible outcome)
#### Situational Fallout

Depending on the context of the Fallout, Fallout can take different forms or intensities. Whenever a consequence calls for **Situational Fallout**, it is asking the player and GM to determine an appropriate level of Fallout given the circumstances of the narrative action. Since all [[resolution-system|Tests]] are made when there is at least an Uncertain outcome, there should always be at least a narrative consequence to triggering Fallout on a Test. If you cannot think of any sort of consequence for a course of action, it should not require a Test. 

##### Levels of Fallout

1. Narrative Fallout - immediate consequences of failing to succeed in a certain task. 
2. Minor Fallout - consequence of a Risky Test, or the overflow result of 1-2 [[damage|Stress]] applied
3. Major Fallout - consequence of a Dire Test, or the overflow result of 3-5 [[damage|Stress]] applied
4. Severe Fallout - consequence of a Desperate Test, or the overflow result 6+ [[damage|Stress]] applied

Minor Fallout is often a result of a Test resulting in a success level with a cost, only causing a Minor Condition, [[equipment|Equipment Stress]], or 1 Mark, then resetting the relevant [[potentials-and-resistance|Stress Track]]. Major Fallout can be a result of a [[resolution-system|Miff]], and causes either [[equipment|Equipment Fallout]], 3 [[damage|Marks]], Minor Condition with 1 Mark, or a Major Condition, then resetting the relevant [[potentials-and-resistance|Stress Track]]. Severe Fallout can only be caused by [[Abilities]], and often causes a Major Condition with 3 [[damage|Marks]] or a number of [[damage|Marks]] equal to the number of [[damage|Stress]] points applied, then resetting the relevant [[potentials-and-resistance|Stress Track]].
