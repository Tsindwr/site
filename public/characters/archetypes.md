# Adventuring Classes

In Sunder, it is difficult to define "classes" as one may in a general TTRPG. Sunder's feature of a class feature market and purchasable features tends to allow players to stray from any defined "class." However, at a very base level, there are initial categories an adventurer can fit into, which begin the prerequisite path for characters to level up and purchase new abilities.
## Archetypes

These categories are called Archetypes, which start an adventurer off with a few abilities and features. One primary attribute they contribute to is an adventurer's Mark pool. The 10 main archetypes and their respective base Marks value are as follows:

| Archetype    | Marks |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Spellslinger | 2     |
| Summoner     | 2     |
| Control      | 3     |
| Face         | 3     |
| Saboteur     | 4     |
| Support      | 4     |
| Frontliner   | 5     |
| Halfcaster   | 5     |
| Healer       | 6     |
| Tank         | 6     |

Archetypes' Marks values are balanced with the starting amount of [[experience|Strings]] they are allowed at character creation.

### Archetype Descriptions

Provided below is a list of short explanations for each archetype. While these archetypes may have specific associations with general TTRPG classes, there are always exceptions to each archetype: your playstyle is yours to choose and the narrative is yours to flavor your decision.

**Spellslingers** specialize in offensive magic, whether it be from synthetic dwoemers, drawing from warp, or sourcing from an arcane entity. Many Wizards, Shamans, Sorcerers, and Warlocks fall under the spellslinger archetype.

**Summoners** use magic to bring physical manifestations into Umbrea for both battle and everyday tasks. These adventurers augment their battlestyle with magic to bring physical attacks, sometimes even enhancing their own bodies. Many Artificers, Druids, Monks, and Mystics fall under the summoner archetype.

**Control** archetype adventurers focus on influencing others both on and off the field.
