# Character Leveling

Character levels in Sunder are a fluid concept, considering [[Abilities]] are purchased using the [[abilities|Experience Market]]. A character with no levels in a specific [[archetypes|Archetype]] could have just as much adventuring capability as a 5th-level adventurer, as long as they have developed their [[abilities]] in a diverse array. However, Archetype leveling is one of the most cost-efficient ways of upgrading a character's [[abilities|Stats]], including the only way to increase their [[damage|Mark]] pool.
## Creating a New Character

Generally, at the beginning of an adventure a character is given 1 [[experience|Milestone]]. Players have the option to purchase a level in a certain Archetype, which costs exactly 1 Milestone. Having a level in an Archetype gives players a more advanced selection of [[Abilities]] whose prerequisites are assigned to specific [[Archetypes]]. 

>[!note] Starting Features
>Aside from the 1 Milestone granted at the beginning of an adventurer's journey, they also need to choose [[origin|Origin]] features, as well as starting scores in their [[potentials-and-resistance|Potentials]]. Starting [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] scores are decided by rolling 3D4 and dropping the highest. If all three D4 values result in a 1, the overall [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] value is a 1.

Gaining a level in an Archetype gives a player the following benefits

- Choose 1 Knack or 1 Perk.
- Choose to increase one [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]]\* or your Mark pool by 1.
- 9 special [[experience|Strings]] that can only be spent on [[Abilities]] with the relevant Archetype as a prerequisite.

\* *Individual [[potentials-and-resistance|Potentials]] can only be increased once per Tier.*

>[!important] 1st-Level Stats
>When you choose your first archetype level as a new adventurer, you gain the following benefits instead of the usual level-up benefits:
>- Starting [[damage|Marks]] determined in [[archetypes|Archetypes]]
>- 1 Domain
>- 2 [[potentials-and-resistance|Skills]]
>- 1 Heroic Goal
### Character Tiers

Characters reach different Tiers of gameplay when they accumulate a certain amount of total Archetype levels. Every Tier is 4 levels apart, and increasing your Tier may effect certain [[Abilities]] that use a character's Tier as a modifier. 

| Character Level | Tier |
| --------------- | ---- |
| 1-4             | I    |
| 5-8             | II   |
| 9-12            | III  |
| 13-16           | IV   |
| 17-20           | V    |

>[!warning] Commoner-level Characters
>Players without a level in any Archetype start with 1 Mark, which is replaced when gaining an archetype. Their Tier is considered 0.
