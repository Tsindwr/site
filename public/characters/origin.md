# Character Origin

Every character has an origin story: whether they have a tragic event that fuels their motivation or a defining moment that marks how they decided to become an adventurer. No matter the adventurer, there is a set of identities that have shaped them into being the person they are today, and that is defined by their **Background** and **Heritage**.[^1]
## Background
###### Profession & Drive

An adventurer's **Background** defines the later half of their backstory: including what they used to do for a living before adventuring and what moments caused them to take on their adventuring role. 
### Profession

The first of these defining sections of one's background is the character's **Profession**. This is a large component of what defines a character's specialties and aptitudes. Whatever the character's role in society before adventuring, whether it was enough to make a living or not, can be considered as their background profession. 
#### Boons:
- 1 Skill proficiency
- 1 Knack
- Functional starting equipment
### Crux

The second defining section of one's background is the character's **Crux**. This marks the most defining moment of an adventurer, an event that impacts their development and likely gives opportunity for growth in their character. This moment both helps identify what drives an adventurer as well as where their flaws originate from.

>[!important]- The Rule of Lovable Characters
>Always remember: a character is only as interesting as their flaws! At the end of the day, TTRPGs are vocally creating a story to be enjoyed by all members at the table. No adventurer is going to be the picture of perfection, and this is what makes them relatable. By creating impactful flaws for the characters we play, we create a profound narrative.

#### Boons:
- +1 to a Potential
- 1 Skill proficiency
- 1 Knack
- 1 Minor goal
- 1 Major goal
- 1 sentimental piece of equipment
## Heritage
###### Descent & Bloodline
An adventurer also gains boons from their upbringing and species. Being a fantasy world, Umbrea's inhabitants not only benefit from the skills taught to them based on their Descent and community, but also gain innate abilities based on their Bloodline.
### Descent

A character's descent represents where and by whom the character was raised. This can include what local specialties the community has cultivated or even specific skills that a young adventurer's parents or guardians would have taught them.
#### Boons:
- 1 Skill proficiency
- 1 Domain
### Bloodline

A character's bloodline represents their connection to the natural Warp of Umbrea. Whether that Warp be from the Faerie & Gloam, from the Land of Storm, or from the influence of the Starry Beyond, characters carry a spark of magic from the world within them. 
#### Boons:
- +1 to a Potential
- 1 special ability (budget: 5 Strings, considered having a prerequisite)

>*Attack Action*:
>
>Once per scene, you may cast a divinatory spell to read the omens surrounding a Near creature. On a successful Sense Test, you gain insight into their fortune in the upcoming tenday: whether it brings Weal or Woe, and any symbolic visions that may accompany it. On a failed Test, your mind is flooded with visions of your own possible fortunes within the next year; you are Dazed until you take a Short Rest, and you cannot use this spell again until you remove the Dazed Condition.
> 
> *Movement Action*:
>
> Once per long rest, you can use this Movement Action to activate the following effects that last until the end of the current scene:
> - Once you activate this ability, recover a number of Mental Resistances equal to your Tier.
> - Once per turn, you may take a reaction transfer an incoming Physical Stress point to a Mental Stress track.
> - You are considered Proficient in unarmed attacks. On a hit, they do Finesse damage equal to a number of Seep Volatility Dice equal to your Tier.
> - You may add "Move Near" to each of your Movement Actions.
> - On each turn, you must make a melee attack against another creature. If there are none within range, you must spend your Movement Action to move towards the nearest creature, and then take your Attack Action. If there are no adversaries within range, this ability targets your allies. Allies within Here range may use a reaction to spend 1 Flavor Token to narrate how they calm your rage. This ends your rage, and avoids expending your Attack Action.
