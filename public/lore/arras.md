# Magick in Tsindwr

## The Wellspring of Essence

Like any sphere of existence, the world of Tsindwr consists of a swirling sea of cosmic truths that define its nature. To art of altering the truths of reality is called **Magick**, and is the basis in which all existence stands. The compound truth of a being, entity, or phenomenon is called its **Essence**: an all-encompassing term for the collection of traits that define the core nature of an individual thing. Entities that are considered individual enough to have their own Essence include the elements, natural forces, and even each individual conscious being. 

To know and understand the Essence of an entity is a vastly difficult task, and mastery may take a decade of deep exposure and meditation on the subject. Only after mastering this intuition of an entity's nature does the entity reveal to a Mage its **Name**: a divine word that encapsulates the nature of an entity. The possession of a Name gives its wielder certain authority over its entity; one who wields a Name may invoke it in a command that harnesses an Essence but is restricted to its definition. One who wields the Name of the sea cannot command it to burn, but may calm its waters for a safe voyage.
