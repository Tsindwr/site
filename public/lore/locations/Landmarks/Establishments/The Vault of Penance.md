>- **Purpose:**
>	- **Imprisonment** – Holding heretics, dissidents, and rogue mages.
>    - **Artifact Containment** – Storing and studying arcane relics too dangerous for public knowledge.
 >   - **Repentance & Trial** – Torture chambers, confession halls, and execution sites for those deemed irredeemable.
>    - **Buried Depths** – Sealed chambers that predate [[The Lord]]’s rule, containing forgotten history, horrors, and mysteries.

> [!info]+ Lore
> The Vault of Penance is a vast subterranean complex beneath Hellhaven, serving as both a prison and a sanctified repository for arcane artifacts deemed heretical by the clergy. It is where the [[Creosmagi]] incarcerates those accused of sorcery, blasphemy, or defiance against [[Locations/Settlements/Haven of Hale/Subpages/Hellhapfen Governance and Power#^abc6e7|The Creed of Binding Light]]. It is also a site of secretive research, as scholars of the church attempt to repurpose dangerous relics for the theocracy’s benefit. The deeper levels, abandoned to the ages, are rumored to hold ancient pre-theocratic ruins, long-forgotten heresies, and prisoners who have been erased from history.
