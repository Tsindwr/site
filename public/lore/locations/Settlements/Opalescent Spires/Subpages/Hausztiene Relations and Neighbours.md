- [[Locations/Settlements/TO BE FLESHED/Dreka Goro]] – A coastal enclave shaped by goblin culture. Exports strange sea-bound spices, jury-rigged devices, and salt-dried reagents.
    
- [[Locations/Settlements/TO BE FLESHED/Bo Renn]] – A rugged mining town at the base of the western mountains. Offers refined minerals, raw ore, and low-cost labor contracts.

## Allies

- **The Skywake Accord**: An alliance of aerial trade pilots and mercantile dirigibles who favor Sauztein Geb for repairs and enhancements.
    
- **Vraekholdt**: A high-perched cliffside settlement once nearly buried in a Fabric quake. Hausztiene engineers helped stabilize the cliff lattice, forging a bond of gratitude and joint seismic research.
    
- **Mirequay**: A fortified, fog-wreathed town along the southern coast. Their reliance on modified Hausztiene filtration tech to cleanse their salt marshes led to lasting cooperation.
    
- **Tasselreed**: A lowland agrarian commune where Hausztiene alchemists once helped contain a crop rot plague with memory-infusion techniques. Now a reliable source of raw alchemic staples.
    
- **Brasshearth Bastion**: An isolated forge-city with deep volcanic roots. Shares experimental metallurgy secrets with Sauztein Geb in return for heat-resistant latticework and energy stabilizers.

## Enemies

- **The Hollow Choir (Fringe Sect)**: Particularly the crystal-obsessed zealots who wish to dissolve Sauztein Geb into resonance.
    
- **The Ironwreath Syndicate**: Criminal infiltrators aiming to siphon resources, sabotage governance, and weaponize mnemonic magic.
    
- **The Ravine Corsairs**: Sea-raiders who occasionally make inland runs for lightfract and memory graft tech.
    
- **The Gleamscour**: A radical eco-purist faction who blames Sauztein Geb’s existence for unbalancing the Fabric and unleashing Echoquakes.

- **[[Locations/Settlements/Ironbound Dynasty/Dwelreach]]**: An underground empire of miners who blame Sauztein Geb's deep-lattice projects for a series of devastating echoquakes that collapsed half their mines, and blocked them off from extracting their ancestral birthright: the lightfract veins.

## Neighbours

- **Yennoc’s Spine**: A vertical settlement clinging to a rift in the southern cliffs; trades in smoked fish, oil-glass, and fissure-grown gems.
    
- **Klev’Sorn**: A nomadic plain-fair town that migrates across the northern hills with great wheeled platforms, bartering seasonal produce and crafts.
    
- **Xereth Vale**: A distant, isolationist society nestled deep in the western mountain fold. Rarely interacts, but tales speak of ancient resonance stabilizers and forgotten lattice scripts.

- **[[Harrowfen]]**: A mist-laden village at the fjord's eastern bend, known for prophetic mushroom cults and soft diplomacy. Maintains a wary but non-hostile distance. One of the main southern Kagekunan entrances.

- **Nauzeret Strand**: A coastal fishing settlement to the southeast with drifting trade barges and a superstition-laced view of Sauztein Geb's skytech as omens.

- **Fenbramble Reach**: A northern marshbound commune using earth-speech and vinecraft; often called upon to assist with botanical anomalies in Hausztiene infrastructure.
