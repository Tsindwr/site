## Layout

### Planning

Sauztein Geb was not built in a traditional fashion—it grew, much like the resonant crystal that pulses through its foundations. Original settlements were small mining alcoves, later interlinked by harmonic scaffolding grown from Spirehand designs. Over centuries, neighborhoods emerged around resonance nodes, forming an uneven but reactive sprawl.

The city is semi-subterranean, tiered into crystalline hollows, shaft-cities, and resonance chambers, most of which follow the natural flow of the lightfract veins. Above ground, shattered crystal towers glimmer under dim skylight, while the true life of the city pulses deeper within.

### Districts

**Core Districts of Sauztein Geb include:**

- **Irid Vaults** – The memory archive halls run by the Chronoscribes. Part library, part fortress, and part prison of unwanted pasts.
    
- **The Rootflumes** – A living architectural region where Spirehands guide crystal-growth to house residential needs. Constantly shifting and humming with latent energy.
    
- **The Loamshaft** – Lowest legal district before collapse zones; flooded with filtered lightfract. Home to poor laborers, smugglers, and dredgers.
    
- **The Upper Chime** – Council-garrisoned plateau above the city. Host to administration towers and the eerie Resonance Bell, which tolls only during echoquake warnings.
    
- **Shardmarket** – The volatile commerce center built atop cracked resonance. Street stalls sell memory-snippets, soulcrystals, dredged relics, and forged futures.
    
- **Hollow Choir Cloisters** – Secretive, crypt-like sanctums carved into forgotten veins, used for sermons and synchrony by the Choir's followers.

## Thoroughfares

### Modes of Travel

- **Latticerails** – Thin levitating tramways that “slide” via attuned harmonic pulses. Dangerous if mistuned—can trigger memory echoes.
    
- **Crystaspires** – Vertical lifts powered by vibrational tuning forks. Sometimes fall into feedback loops during city-wide resonance flux.
    
- **Walkwinds** – Subterranean walkways reinforced with echo-barriers to prevent cognitive spill. Many are privately guarded.
    
- **Chimebeasts** – Semi-domesticated fauna bred for resonance navigation, used mostly in Loamshaft areas. Glimmer-skinned and eerily silent.

### Travel in the City

Navigating Sauztein means avoiding zones of high echo saturation, where time distorts or fractures may occur. Citizens carry memory tags—inscribed talismans tied to their current moment—to anchor their consciousness in linear flow.

Certain paths shift when the city re-harmonizes weekly, meaning maps must be updated constantly by the Spirehands and Chronoscribes.

### Entry and Reentry

Entry to the city requires passing through Mnemonic Clearance Points, where:

- Your surface memory is scanned for hostile echoes or illegal grafts
    
- Visitors are assigned a “Reverence Anchor,” a mind-stabilizing charm
    

Reentry is harder. Citizens who’ve been outside too long are subject to drift, where memory becomes misaligned. The longer you're gone, the more you may forget where you belong.

## Architecture

### Materials

- **Resonant Crystal** (lightfract, amberglas, shadestone)
    
- **Echo-etched Limestone**
    
- **Boneglass** (calcified, infused with sonic runes)
    
- **Rootmetal Filament** – organic alloy grown from fungal-metal hybrid veins
    

Structures are partially sung into form by choir-architects or molded through vibration-sculpting.

### Development

Each building evolves with the needs of its inhabitants—walls bend subtly over time to accommodate emotional frequencies, and “echo doors” may open only when specific memories are thought of.

Districts sometimes shift their boundaries overnight during harmonic tremors. These events are called Veinbursts.

### Landmarks

- **The Irid Archive Spindle** – A shimmering monolith that spirals down 13 levels, housing centuries of recorded memory.
    
- **The Resonance Bell** – Ancient crystal bell suspended over a fracture nexus. Its toll stabilizes the city... or shatters it further.
    
- **Mirror Hollow** – A fault-pocket of pure mnemonic bleed, where visitors see versions of themselves that never existed.
    
- **The Lattice Cairn** – A Spirehand memorial, pulsing gently with the death-harmonies of those who shaped the city’s veins.
    
- **The Nullspire Column** – A condemned pillar of crystal where memory cannot exist. Used for exile or purification rituals.

## Climate

Sauztein Geb exists within a filtered geoluminal basin—light does not behave normally here. There is no traditional day-night cycle, but rather pulses of photonic bloom and luminous decay, both of which affect memory coherence.

Air is dry but thick with particulate resonance. Winds hum. Echostorms occasionally tear through sectors, leaving behind memory-slick surfaces and spectral afterimages.

## 🌱 Environment

### Flora

> **Crystawheat** – Edible shard-grain grown under false-light. Tough but sustaining.  
> **Glowfane Ivy** – Climbs walls and lights districts at night, but may remember the voices it hears too often.  
> **Vireling Bloom** – A fragile flower said to grow only where deep memory is buried. Used in mourning rites.

---

### Fauna

> **Chimebeasts** – Docile, vibration-sensitive mounts used by lower dwellers.  
> **Lurkrill** – Insectoid tunnel scavengers, feast on memory-fragments.  
> **Dewdancers** – Tiny glider-creatures made of silk and dust. They feed on psychic residue.

---

### Pests

> **Shardmice** – Glass-bodied rodents that gnaw through mindglass for warmth. Sometimes steal stray memories.  
> **Resonance Wasps** – Aggressive creatures that inject mnemonic venom. Victims experience looping thoughts or false pasts.  
> **Nullmolds** – Fungal infections that erase history from buildings and people alike. Dangerous and hard to detect.
