## **Symbolism**

> [!important]+ **Emblem/Crest**  
> A fractured prism set within a stylized eye, ringed by thirteen concentric lines (each representing a failed collapse prevented by Council intervention).

> [!important]+ **Mascot**  
> _“The Whisperwren”_ — a small, glass-winged bird believed to nest in harmonic flares. Its song is used to detect unstable memory pockets before they rupture.

## **Settlement Leaders**

> _Governance in Sauztein Geb is tripartite, but imbalanced: the Council’s presence dominates, local guild authority struggles for autonomy, and spiritual influences subtly manipulate beneath the surface._

- [[Queen Liraenne du Virelys]] 
	The current monarch of Sauztein Geb, descended directly from the astral elven line of Don Morcoux. Regal, inscrutable, and known for her radiant presence, she wears the Opalescent Crown with both grace and quiet dread. Rumors suggest she communes with something within the oldest ruins beneath the palace.
	
- **Overpréfet Cerid Banlot** _(Crystallis Council Spokesperson)_  
    Wields veto power over major legislation and coordinates Concord military deployment. Pragmatic, detached, and views the city as a crystalline fuse waiting to blow.
    
- **Guildmistress Thaerila Vennarienne** _(Chronoscribes Leader)_  
    Enforces memory legislation, manages the Irid Archive, and oversees the use of sanctioned mnemonic technologies.
    
- **High Resonant Tellun Sar** _(Temple of the Crystalline Veil)_  
    Spiritual authority across resonance rites and rituals; not officially part of governance, but his sermons are studied like law.
    
- **Magistrate Jessa Truanne** _(Civil Order & Mediation)_  
    Oversees court systems and inter-faction disputes; known for being both just and deeply exhausted.

> [!done]- **The Spirehands Guild** 
> Crystal-shapers and infrastructure builders. Control Rootflume architecture.  

> [!done]- **The Temple of the Crystalline Veil** 
> Keepers of resonance theology. Their doctrine shapes public rituals and holidays.  

> [!done]- **The Undergleam Kin** 
> Radical rebels, secessionists, and echo-sick outcasts. Hidden in the lower shafts.  

> [!done]- **The Lightfract Smugglers** 
> Blackglass and resonance dealers. Control the illicit “emotional experience” market.  

> [!done]- **The Concord Representatives** 
> External governors and military supervisors from Hellhaven. Prioritize resource security over local lives.

## **Crime**

> Despite Concord surveillance, crime is rampant and often sonic, mnemonic, or metaphysical in nature.

- **Blackglass Trafficking**: Illegal trade of volatile scrying crystal. Powers resonance heists and prophetic terrorism.
    
- **Echo Theft**: Stealing identity-fragments from others, often resold to dream dens or used to forge artificial selves.
    
- **Fracture Poaching**: Entering unstable zones without a dredging license to scavenge memory relics.
    
- **Resonance Sabotage**: Weaponizing harmonic pulses to cause structural collapses or public auditory hallucinations.
    
- **Soulloop Sculpting**: Creating illegal mnemonic loops for luxury reliving or torturous punishment.
