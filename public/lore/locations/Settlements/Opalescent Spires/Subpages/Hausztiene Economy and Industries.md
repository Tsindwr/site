## Invention

Sauztein is one of the most innovation-forward cities in the Council due to its access to lightfract, a living crystal network that amplifies mnemonic and temporal magics. Invention here is not just mechanical—it is psycho-arcane. Artificers, scribe-smiths, and echo-forgers work in experimental harmony with memory-sourced blueprints, often creating devices that already _remember_ how they should function.

The Chronoscribes regulate dangerous invention by locking volatile designs behind Mnemonic Seals, which require synchronized minds to access. Smuggled blueprints are often encrypted in dreamscapes.

## Resources

### Distribution

- **Lightfract Veins**: Controlled by the Spirehands Guild and taxed by the Council.
    
- **Memory Crystals (Aetherlace)**: Allocated under Council permits, regulated by the Chronoscribes.
    
- **Filtered Echoresin**: Distributed by the Hollow Choir's intermediaries to shadow-markets and low-tier inventors.
    

### Imports

- **Nutrient Slabs & Synthmeals** from Hellhaven Concord.
    
- **Binding Alloys & Fracture-Alloys** from Winbor Coast refineries.
    
- **Soulglass Components** from Drosvenna’s arcane salvage.
    
- **Fresh Minds**—conscripted or “volunteered” individuals for memory-labor.
    

### Income

- Export of stabilized Lightfract Shards and temporal-laced relics.
    
- Licensing Council-backed mnemonic prosthetics.
    
- Illicit trade in blackmarket memory snippets and loop-sculpting art.
    
- Council’s interest subsidies on experimental containment tech.

## 🏭 Key Industries

> [!abstract]- **Mnemonic Crafting**  
> Creation of memory-based devices, temporal stabilizers, emotion-charged tools, and recall tokens. Used in both medicine and warfare.

> [!abstract]- **Lightfract Resonance Tuning**  
> The refinement and shaping of Sauztein’s native crystal into usable infrastructure or psycho-reactive tech.

> [!abstract]- **Memory Dredging & Loop Containment**  
> Salvage and repair of timeline fractures. Recovery agents are trained to navigate nonlinear events and extract stable chrono-matter.

> [!abstract]- **Echo-Engineering**  
> Arcane-construction based on sound, harmonics, and memorywave attunement. Used to grow buildings, machines, and even sentient architectures.

> [!abstract]- **Mind-Sculpting & Dreamsmithing**  
> A luxury and blackmarket art—crafting or rewriting memories and personality shards for clients. Technically illegal unless licensed.

### 🎭 Niche Professions

> [!abstract]- **Time-Attuner**  
> Tunes personal devices to a user’s chronostability. Prevents unintentional duplication, collapse, or loop fragmentation.

> [!abstract]- **Loop-Weaver**  
> Designs stable microloops to preserve environments, art, or personalities in fixed-time scenarios. Sometimes hired to create haunted installations.

> [!abstract]- **Shard-Daemonist**  
> Specialist in semi-sentient crystal formations. Often bonded to a Lightfract warden-beast for urban maintenance.

> [!abstract]- **Memurgeon**  
> A surgeon who manipulates emotional and temporal scars instead of physical wounds. Used for trauma removal or espionage resets.

> [!abstract]- **Echo-Sealer**  
> Creates echo-null zones to shield areas from memory or time bleed. Common in high-security or ritual spaces.

> [!abstract]- **Cognition Broker**  
> Middlemen who trade memory-snippets, often customizing narratives for customers’ personal myths, trauma therapy, or addiction.

> [!abstract]- **Dreamwright**  
> Elite artisan hired to construct fully immersive mnemonic landscapes, often for mourning, inspiration, or rehabilitation.
