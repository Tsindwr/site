## **The Opal Court & Council**

- [[Queen Liraenne du Virelys]] – The current monarch of Sauztein Geb, descended directly from the astral elven line of Don Morcoux. Regal, inscrutable, and known for her radiant presence, she wears the Opalescent Crown with both grace and quiet dread. Rumors suggest she communes with something within the oldest ruins beneath the palace.

- [[Archmagus Thévain d’Aurelac]] – Master of Arcane Conservation, responsible for studying, interpreting, and preserving the Novachron glyphs within the ancient stonework. Quiet and pale, with opal-veined eyes and a delicate touch with magic that seems to bend time.

- [[Butler Alistelle de Lioranne]] – Noble representative of the fertile southern fiefdoms. Known for her charm, decadent salons, and politically dangerous gossip. Her allegiances shift like tides, but she always lands on her feet.

- [[Comte Vaurien de Rochambre]] – Lord of the highland mines, his family manages the extraction of precious minerals from the crystal-laced caverns. Gruff and utilitarian, he sees the monarchy as sacred but believes in the strength of coin above all.

- [[Seigneur Marné Vallisque]] – Merchant king of Sauztein Geb’s opal and spellglass trade. Wears rings laced with raw aural energy and speaks in glowing economic prophecy. Some suspect he’s secretly funding an arcane monopoly.

- [[Chevalière Ylisse Dornévant]] – Commander of the royal guard, known as the Shardsworn. Stoic, battle-scarred, and unshakably loyal to the Queen, but whispered to have a personal vendetta against the swamp-dwellers of Hly’draug.

- [[Victoire Nemevalle]] – High Priestess of the Luminous Echo, Sauztein Geb’s primary faith centered around ancestral resonance and starlight memory. Gentle in tone but utterly ruthless in rooting out corruption or false divination.

- [[Maître Cerelune Briavell]] – Representative of the artisan caste and guild leader of the Weavers of Prismatic Craft. Wields enormous influence through enchanted fashion, memory-infused sculpture, and dream-distilled perfumes.

- [[Warden Thrannic Delmarr]] - Grey dwarven Prince of Dwelreach, heir to the Delricht throne, and sole reason for the end of the Auroral Vein Dispute. Spends most of his time under soft guard in the Crystalseal Pavilion, but is present during public-facing events as a reminder to the Opal Court's power and influence.

## **The Chronoscribes** _(Arcane archivists of memory and time)_

- **[[Archivist Elenvoir Morchaude]]** – Stoic and prismatic-eyed, she leads the Chronoscribes from the Irid Archive. Known for her emotionless clarity and capacity to recall exact seconds from centuries ago.

- **[[Scribe-Lieutenant Jome Aethern'e]]** – Oversees Echoquake containment; rumored to be experimenting with illegal mnemonic grafting tech to predict future fractures.

- **[[Memorist Vel Curneaux]]** – A low-ranking scribe who illegally sells memory-snippets to black market artisans and memory dens. He seeks redemption—or at least escape.

## **The Undergleam Kin** _(Tunnel-dwelling rebels and outcast communities)_

- [[Rin "Coalcut" Marrev]] – A former Spirehand who turned revolutionary after her brother succumbed to Refraction Sickness due to poor zone management in the lower shafts.
    
- [[Tahlin "Le Langue'eclat"]] – Prophet of the Hollow Choir’s fringe sect; his body is laced with growing, living crystal. Preaches a coming moment when “all time shall hum in one note.”
    
- [[Maedren Skellieu]] – Smuggler of filtered lightfract for poor districts. Hates the Council for its exploitative mining practices and sabotage of memory dredgers.

## **Spirehands Guild** _(Arcane builders and crystal-shapers)_

- [[Maitre-Tailleur Alvix Dorneux]] – Oversees structural reshaping of the Rootflumes. Respected for his architectural genius, but slowly losing cohesion due to prolonged exposure to raw harmonics.
    
- [[Apprentice Lurelle Vauxl'e]] – A prodigy who hears the lattice’s “whispers.” Secretly being courted by both the Council’s elite and the Hollow Choir.
    
- [[Ruthen Bexot]] – Overseer of residential Spire-growth. Blunt, practical, deeply concerned about unstable districts, and suspected of passing info to the Undergleam Kin.

## **The Crystallis Council Representatives** _(Governors, diplomats, and enforcers from the Hellhaven Concord)_

- [[Overpref'et Cerid Banlot]] – Political liaison from Hellhaven. Believes Sauztein Geb is expendable if the crystal instability spreads.
    
- [[Magistrate Jessa Truanne]] – A Council enforcer sympathetic to the city’s citizens. Maintains order with minimal violence, but her leash is shortening.
    
- [[Dainhardt Glimmerung]] – Secretly part of the Ironwreath Syndicate. Posing as a Concordist official while mining influence, literal and metaphorical.

## **Memory Dredgers** _(Recovery agents and first responders for echo-fractures)_

- [[Draguer Ilim Myrthe]] – Famous for rescuing a whole district from loop-collapse. Carries dozens of stored memories not his own, and it's wearing thin.
    
- [[Tessari Drahme]] – Works in the poor rings, often for free. Was once a scribe but now refuses to speak except in mnemonic glyphs.
    
- [[Rokk Denlire]] – Veteran dredger with a mechanical arm fitted with tuning forks and harmonizers. Hates the Spirehands for abandoning his collapsed family zone.

## **Lightfract Smugglers & Blackglass Dealers**

- [[Vain "Mirrorcut" Solen]] – Dandy-like thief and rogue scholar of resonance. Collects rare reflections and forgotten timelines like trophies.
    
- [[Casseth Orlun]] – Runs an illegal “memory bar” where clients relive curated emotional experiences. Ex-scribe with a price on her head.
    
- [[Yvette Farv]] – Imports blackglass (unstable crystal used for scrying), and distributes it across unstable sectors to **“accelerate the truth.”**

## **Temple of the Crystalline Veil**

- [[High Resonant Tellun Sartre]] – Beloved spiritual leader who once sang a resonance so pure it stalled an entire collapse. Now fading, literally—phasing in and out of the moment.
    
- [[Echo Sister Pryll]] – Enforces doctrine with unsettling serenity. Believes silence is sacred and often speaks through lightfract-script or gesture.
    
- [[Vicar Jonrith Daiveux]] – A rising priest-artist who “paints with sound,” creating audible mosaics in public prayer domes.
