## Language

Empir Draconi boasted a rich linguistic tradition, with Draconic serving as the official language of governance, magic, and high culture. However, regional dialects and influences from trade partners and vassal states contributed to a diverse linguistic landscape.

### Dialects and Accents

- **High Draconic** – The formal dialect spoken by the ruling elite, scholars, and magisters. This version was infused with arcane phrasing and complex grammatical structures.
- **Imperial Common** – The lingua franca of the empire, derived from Draconic but simplified for ease of use among traders, artisans, and commoners.
- **Dockside Creole** – A blend of Imperial Common, regional tongues, and foreign influences, spoken in trade hubs and docking settlements.
- **Deep Cant** – The dialect of those who fled to the Kagecombs, heavily influenced by underground survivalist slang and cryptic phrasing meant to conceal meaning from outsiders.

## Developmental Impacts

The expansion of floating cities and subterranean enclaves influenced every aspect of Empir Draconi’s social structure. The wealthy and powerful resided in elevated cities, looking down—both literally and figuratively—on those in the docking settlements below. Meanwhile, the island kingdom, which served as the heart of the empire, became a highly stratified society where proximity to the emperor often dictated political influence.

With the fall of the empire, the survivors’ adaptations led to further divergence in culture and daily life. Those in the wastes maintained vestiges of imperial grandeur, while the Kagecombs’ denizens developed a pragmatic and secretive society, valuing adaptability and communal survival over status and tradition.

## Culture

### Cuisine

- **Skyborne Feasts** – Lavish meals consisting of rare meats, exotic fruits, and spiced wines, reserved for the floating city elites.
- **Seafarer’s Fare** – Fresh seafood, preserved kelp, and fermented delicacies were staples for those on the island kingdom before its sinking.
- **Dockside Stews** – Hearty meals made from accessible ingredients like root vegetables, dried meats, and sea salt.
- **Wasteland Rations** – In the post-collapse world, foragers rely on roasted drakegrass, ember vine fruit, and smoked storm drake meat.
- **Kagecombs Brews** – Distilled from underground fungi and bioluminescent algae, these potent drinks are both nourishment and ritual offering.

### Rich/Poor Gap

Wealth disparity in Empir Draconi was pronounced. The aristocracy resided in floating palaces of aetherstone, removed from the struggles of common laborers. The merchant class, while influential, still relied on imperial favor to maintain their status. Below them, dock workers, farmers, and artisans lived under strict economic hierarchies. Following the empire’s fall, the survivors saw a forced equalization—those who retained knowledge of imperial technology or arcane secrets held an advantage, while former elites struggled to adjust to the new world order.

### Outsiders

Empir Draconi maintained a wary stance toward outsiders, balancing diplomacy with displays of strength.

- **Allied Traders** – Merchant guilds from neighboring regions were permitted controlled access to docking settlements but rarely allowed into floating cities.
- **Vassal Tribes** – Some indigenous peoples were assimilated into the empire, while others resisted, leading to ongoing conflicts.
- **Arcane Scholars** – Foreign mages sought entry to study the empire’s advances in magic, though few were granted permission without proving loyalty.
- **Post-Fall Relations** – In the wake of the empire’s collapse, survivors in the wastes and Kagecombs remain suspicious of newcomers, viewing them as potential threats or resources to exploit.
