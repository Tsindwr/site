## Settlement Leaders

Though Empir Draconi was an empire, governance was handled by a **council of magisters and appointed officials** under the emperor.

- **The Emperor** – A dragon ruler believed to be the avatar of The Weaver. Their reign was marked by both reverence and political intrigue.
- **The Magisterium** – A council of twelve arcane scholars and statesmen who oversaw the empire’s laws, research, and elemental affairs.
- **The Warden of [[The Arras]]** – A single archmage dedicated to maintaining balance in magic and ensuring the stability of the empire’s leyline-based infrastructure.
- **The High Talon** – The supreme commander of the empire’s military forces, often a dragon or draconic warlord.

>[!example]+ Legislation
>## The Mandates of Dominion
>>[!quote]- **The Codex Imperius**
>>A series of laws dictating the hierarchy of rule, the upkeep of magic, and the empire’s doctrine of expansion. Any challenge to the Codex was considered heresy, punishable by death or exile to the Kagecombs.

## Factions

Empir Draconi was rife with internal factions, each vying for control, knowledge, or survival in the empire’s tumultuous political landscape.

> [!done]- **The Ashen Pact** (*deceased)*)

> [!done]- **The Riftborne** *(active)*

## Crime

Empir Draconi’s society was highly regulated, with magic itself being one of the most **controlled resources**. However, many underground movements sought to **subvert, steal, or weaponize arcane power**.

- **Soulforging** – The illegal practice of binding souls into magical objects, creating immensely powerful relics at a horrific cost.
- **Fabric Piracy** – Smugglers who harnessed unstable leyline currents to transport goods and fugitives.
- **Blood Rituals** – Forbidden dark magic involving dragon or draconic-blood sacrifices, rumored to enhance a sorcerer’s power.
- **Artifact Theft** – The Magisterium heavily monitored magical artifacts, but rogue scholars and thieves often sought to claim lost relics for their own gain.
- **Coup Conspiracies** – Political intrigue was a way of life, and entire networks existed to overthrow rulers or install puppet leaders.
