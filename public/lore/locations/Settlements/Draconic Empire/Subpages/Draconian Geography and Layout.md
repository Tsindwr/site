## Layout

Empir Draconi was born from the unity of warring states upon a vast island kingdom, an expanse of fertile land and volcanic peaks surrounded by the temperamental sea. The empire’s heart lay in the capital, a city of towering basalt citadels and grand avenues paved with polished obsidian. From this center of power, emperors and the Magisterium ruled with calculated authority, their dominion stretching outward through fortified ports, sprawling agricultural terraces, and mining colonies rich with precious ores.
### Planning

While the floating cities became the pride of the empire, the land itself remained its foundation. The empire's mainland domains, including its annexed territories and coastal fortresses, provided the resources necessary for its continued expansion. The grand roads, paved with arcane-reinforced stone, connected its provinces, ensuring the swift movement of legions, goods, and imperial decrees. These regions were governed by high lords and imperial magistrates, maintaining order and enforcing the will of the emperor.

### Districts

Empir Draconi’s dominion was vast, divided into distinct regions, each serving a crucial role:

- **The Imperial Heartland** – The ruling seat of the empire, housing the Magisterium, the emperor’s palace, and the grand arenas of law and war.
    
- **The Celestial Bastions** – The floating cities, each a self-sufficient entity hosting scholars, military garrisons, and the elite of society.
    
- **The Dock-Cities** – The fortified mountain settlements that managed commerce and passage between the sky and the land.
    
- **The Outer Provinces** – The agricultural and mining regions, sustaining the empire’s economy and supplying its war machine.
    
- **The Border Forts** – Strongholds that marked the limits of the empire, guarding against both foreign invaders and internal dissent.

## Thoroughfares

### Modes of Travel

- **Sky-Galleons** – Vast airships that connected floating cities to the land, powered by arcane propulsion.
    
- **Imperial Roads** – Enchanted highways that allowed swift and efficient movement between the empire’s key holdings.
    
- **Drake-Carriages** – Beasts of burden bred for speed and endurance, serving nobility and military officers alike.

### Travel in the Empire

Imperial decree strictly controlled access to its floating cities. Entry required sanctioned writs, granted only to merchants, scholars, and officials. The dock-cities managed trade and migration, ensuring that only those deemed worthy ascended to the skies.

### Entry and Reentry

- **The Gilded Arch** – The grand entrance to the imperial capital, a gate of obsidian and gold, guarded by elite sentinels.
    
- **The Azure Gateways** – The enchanted portals that linked the floating cities, accessible only by those who held the emperor’s favor.
    
- **The Iron Watch** – The heavily fortified border gates, defending the empire’s most vulnerable frontiers.

## Architecture

### Materials

- **Aetherstone** – The foundation of the floating cities, an arcane mineral infused with levitational properties.
    
- **Blacksteel and Obsidian** – The primary materials of imperial construction, resilient and imposing.
    
- **Glasscrete** – A fusion of volcanic sand and enchanted binding agents, forming the empire’s transparent yet unyielding structures.

### Development

The mastery of Empir Draconi’s arcanists and engineers saw the birth of an age of unparalleled innovation. In the later centuries of the Gnosichron Era, the empire undertook its most ambitious endeavor: the separation of mountaintops from their earthly roots, shaping them into great floating cities sustained by aetherstone and tethered to the arcane fabric of the world. These airborne bastions did not replace the island kingdom but instead served as mobile strongholds, centers of governance, and testaments to the empire’s command over both magic and nature. Below them, dock-cities emerged at the severed peaks, vital trade hubs linking the heavens and the land.

### Landmarks

- **The Magisterium Spire** – The seat of arcane governance, where scholars and artificers dictated the advancement of magical sciences.
    
- **[[Locations/Settlements/Draconic Empire/Establishments/The Sunforged Coliseum]]** – A grand arena where warriors proved their worth before the emperor’s gaze.
    
- **The Riftvault Archives** – A subterranean vault containing ancient knowledge, accessible only to the empire’s most trusted minds.
