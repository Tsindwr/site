## Invention
Hellhaven thrives on arcano-mechanical advancements, blending etheric technology, imported [[Locations/Settlements/TO BE FLESHED/Vergrenzig]] engineering, and its own unique resources, such as [[petrolune]]—a volatile, semi-organic mineral that can store and release arcane power in controlled bursts.

#### **Creosmark Tokens** – The Soulbound Permits

^3c24dc

One of Hellhaven’s most controversial and omnipresent inventions is the Creosmark Token, issued to all citizens. These tokens are:

- Forged from [[petrolune]], infused with a drop of the bearer’s blood, and soul-bound upon activation.
- Essential for movement, as [[Creosmagi]] (clergy enforcers) scan them to ensure individuals are where they belong.
- While enforced by the [[Creosmagi]], they are handled and governed by the [[#^ed5799|Creosmark Administration]].
- Personalized, containing a record of employment, permissions, and any legal infractions.
- Temporarily deactivated as punishment, preventing access to workplaces or barring movement beyond certain districts.
- Illegally forged or stolen tokens are worthless, as they are inert to anyone except their bound owner.

These tokens are administered and maintained by [[Locations/Landmarks/Establishments/The Lord’s Tithe Commission]], which enforces their distribution, renewal, and revocation.

#### **Petrolune Firelances** – The "Lawgiver" Weapons

- [[Petrolune]]'s explosive properties have been harnessed into firelances, carried by elite [[Creosmagi]].
- These weapons function as arcane muskets, launching controlled etheric bursts at criminals and dissenters.
- The higher-ranking enforcers wield Lawgiver variants, which have multiple firing modes, including:
    - **Judgment Shot** – A concussive blast to incapacitate.
    - **Retribution Arc** – A burning bolt of searing energy.
    - **Atonement Lance** – A restraining etheric tether.

#### Petrolune-Powered Pneumatic Rails

Due to the winding, steep, and uneven terrain of Hellhaven, traditional carts struggle to navigate the streets. Instead, the city has developed:

- Pneumatic rail carts that use controlled petrolune combustion to propel passenger lifts, cargo trams, and supply trolleys.
- These systems operate on sealed pressure channels, reducing the risk of uncontrolled explosions.
- Stations exist at various altitude points, allowing easier movement for workers and goods**.

### **Etheric Power Harnessing** 

Instead of petrolune, the city utilizes arcane energy similar to electricity, imported from Vergrenzig’s research. This fuels lamplights, lifts, and industrial machines.

#### Self-Winding Automata

Gnome- and dwarf-crafted mechanical constructs assist in shipbuilding, mining, and clerical duties.
#### Sealock Mechanisms

Engineering advancements in docking technology allow ships to be elevated between sea levels using arcane hydraulics.

- **Exotic Metals** – Required for precision mechanics and high-grade shipbuilding.
- **Luxury Goods** – Silk, wines, and rare spices for the merchant elite.
### Income
- **Shipbuilding and Naval Engineering** – The city thrives on maritime industry, producing warships, trading vessels, and steam-powered submersibles.
- **Legal Tithes and Fines** – Citizens are taxed for nearly everything, from travel permits to business licenses.
- **Industrial Manufacturing** – Factories churn out machine parts, processed fuel, and enchanted tools for export.
- **Religious Pilgrimage** – The faithful travel from afar to seek judgment, redemption, or penance, contributing to the economy through lodging and service fees.
