>A dark elven ruler who forged alliances between the isolated settlements of the Kagecombs, establishing trade routes that would later become crucial for resettlement on the surface.

>[!danger]- **Hierophant-Magus Aulmareth** *(d. ~1920)*
>An enigmatic mage-priest who prophesied the end of the elemental storms decades before they ceased. Some believe he played a secret role in stabilizing [[The Arras]], though his followers insist he ascended before he could witness the world’s return to the surface.

> [!danger]- **Felecia Everhart, The Last Matron** *(d. ~1940)* 
> Felecia Everhart was the final Matron of the Mist Shapers, a secretive sect of mages who were once revered for their ability to manipulate the strange energies left behind by the Elemental Storm.

His initial involvement in Hellhaven's early mercantile agreements saw him broker several under-the-table deals with the clergy, providing essential supplies during the city’s rebuild. Norrick’s fortunes changed after a failed attempt to seize power during a factional civil war. His escape into the outer gulf marked the beginning of his infamous pirate career.
