### **Criminal Organizations**

Despite the [[Creosmagi]]’s brutal efficiency, Hellhaven’s oppressed lower classes have fueled the rise of secret societies and insurgent groups:

- **[[Concordat of Chains#^151c8a|The Hooded Covenant]]** – A hidden sect within the clergy itself, questioning [[The Lord]]’s divinity.
- **The Hollowed** – A group of former citizens stripped of their [[locations/Settlements/Haven of Hale/Subpages/Hellhapfen Economy and Industries#**Creosmark Tokens** – The Soulbound Permits|Creosmarks]], surviving in the city’s ruins.
- **The Gilded Knives** – An elite guild of assassins and spies, operating under noble patronage. ^dcfae3
