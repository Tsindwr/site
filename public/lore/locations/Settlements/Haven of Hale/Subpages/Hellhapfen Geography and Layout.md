## Layout
### Planning
Hellhaven is a meticulously planned city, structured around strict principles of order and efficiency dictated by [[The Lord]]’s adjudicators. Streets follow a rigid grid pattern, with major roads radiating outward from [[Locations/Landmarks/Establishments/The Vault of Penance]], ensuring that all paths symbolically lead back to the center of divine and legal authority. Walls and barriers segment the city into carefully controlled districts, each serving a distinct purpose. Watchtowers, checkpoints, and observation posts are positioned to monitor movement, ensuring that no illicit activity escapes the gaze of [[The Lord]]’s enforcers.
### Districts
Hellhaven, also known in ancient records as Gellhafn, has grown into a sprawling metropolis of industry, faith, and maritime power. The city is a crucial trade hub, thanks to its strategic position at the mouth of a fjord-lined gulf, and its culture has absorbed steampunk innovations from [[Locations/Settlements/TO BE FLESHED/Vergrenzig]], blending them with strict religious oversight.
#### **The Adjudicary** 
_(Government & Religious Quarter)_

- Seat of [[The Lord]]’s clergy, including [[Locations/Landmarks/Establishments/The Vault of Penance]] and [[Locations/Landmarks/Establishments/The Codexorium]], where divine law is dictated and transcribed. The city’s ruling sect, [[Concordat of Chains|The Concordat of Chains]], enforces unwavering obedience.
#### **The Tribunal Forum** 
_(Commerce & Civil Affairs)_

- Bustling with trade halls, judicial squares, and regulated markets. [[Locations/Landmarks/Establishments/Arbiter’s Call]], a bureaucratic stronghold, ensures that all transactions remain under the watchful eyes of the clergy.
#### **Chainmoor Brine Yards** 
_(Docks & Industrial Shipping)_

- A vast shipyard, famed for producing steam-powered vessels using [[Locations/Settlements/TO BE FLESHED/Vergrenzig]]-imported innovations. The district is dense with warehouses, repair docks, and smuggling rings hiding within the labyrinthine canals.
#### **The Ironclad Sprawl** 
_(Tinker’s & Artificer’s Quarter)_

- A newer district, filled with mechanists, artificers, and alchemists, many of whom are immigrants from [[Locations/Settlements/TO BE FLESHED/Vergrenzig]]. Gas-lit signs flicker above shopfronts, advertising arcane-electric engines, clockwork contraptions, and mechanized limbs.
#### **The Aegis Quarter** 
_(Military Quarter)_

- A fortified garrison, where the [[locations/Settlements/Haven of Hale/Subpages/Hellhapfen Governance and Power#^c5ef99|Archprelate of Binds]] maintains an iron grip on security. The [[Creosmagi]] train here, and ship docks service military patrol vessels.
#### **Penitent’s Rise** 
_(Residential & Clerical Housing)_

- A dense multi-tiered district stacked along the city’s steepest inclines, where the city’s middle class and clerical administrators reside. Golemic lifts, powered by arcane electricity, ferry people between levels.
#### **The Chainstock Wards** 
_(Industrial Slums & Low-Class Housing)_

- A smog-choked, overcrowded district where factory workers, dock laborers, and debt-bound "Redemptives" toil beneath the looming spires of the wealthier districts above.
#### **The Wraithmire Quarter** 
_(Shrouded & Haunted Ruins)_

- The oldest part of the city, a ghostly, mist-covered ruin from the elemental storm’s fallout centuries ago. Few dare to live here, but some black-market traders, fugitives, and heretics hide in the mist-choked alleyways.
## Thoroughfares
### Modes of Travel
Due to Hellhaven’s steep and winding streets, traditional carts struggle to traverse the city. Instead, the following alternative transportation methods have developed:

- **Treadwalkers** – Clockwork exoskeletal frames, resembling steam-powered stilts, allow couriers and enforcers to ascend steep roads with ease.
- **Golemic Lifts** – Towering arcane-powered elevators assist movement between altitude levels, commonly found in Penitent’s Rise and The Tribunal Forum.
- **Skyferries** – Suspended tram-like gondolas, powered by arcane-electric current, ferry goods and passengers across the city’s highest districts.
- **Canal Ferries** – Many of Hellhaven’s lower districts have waterways, where flat-bottomed steam skiffs operate as taxi services.
### Travel in the City
- **Checkpoint System** – Each district has controlled entry points where movement is monitored. Travel papers are required for restricted areas, such as The Adjudicary.
- **Curfew Enforcement** – At sundown, non-essential movement is forbidden unless sanctioned.
### Entry and Reentry
- **The Gate of Submission** – The main landward entry into Hellhaven, where newcomers are interrogated and documented.
- **Brineyard Inspection Docks** – All ships must register cargo and passengers upon arrival. Unregistered arrivals face severe punishment. Located in [[#Chainmoor Brine Yards _(Docks & Industrial Shipping)_|Chainmoor Brine Yards]].
- **The Inner Gates** – Sections of the city are separated by gated corridors, restricting access to sensitive areas.
## Architecture
### Materials
Hellhaven’s architecture is built with a mix of local stone, imported steel, and arcane-powered lighting:

- **Obsidian-Grey Brick & Ironwood Reinforcement** – The foundational material for most buildings, durable enough to withstand the coastal gales.
- **Arcane-Electric Streetlights** – Imported from [[Locations/Settlements/TO BE FLESHED/Vergrenzig]], these tesla-like lamps harness engineered magic, emitting a steady white-blue glow.
- **Copper-Inscribed Sigils** – Many official buildings feature etched symbols of [[The Lord]]’s decree, warding glyphs, and reinforcement runes.
### Development
#### 1st Era: The Refuge of the Mist (Founding of Gellhafn, 1354)

- Hellhaven, originally Gellhafn, was founded as a sanctuary for refugees fleeing the devastation of the elemental storms of the [[Tenechron]]—a catastrophic event that left arcane-laden mist lingering along the coastline.
- The city’s first settlers were survivors, building atop the ruins of a preexisting civilization, remnants of which still exist in Wraithmire Quarter.
#### 2nd Era: The Industrial Reform (Trade with Vergrenzig, 1970s)

- [[Locations/Settlements/TO BE FLESHED/Vergrenzig]]’s steampunk innovations reached Hellhaven, revolutionizing shipbuilding, arcane-electric power, and mechanical craftsmanship.
- [[locations/Settlements/Haven of Hale/Subpages/Hellhapfen Geography and Layout#**Chainmoor Brine Yards** _(Docks & Industrial Shipping)_|The Chainmoor Brine Yards]] and Ironclad Sprawl expanded, turning the city into a technological and maritime powerhouse.
- However, industrialization brought new tensions, with [[Locations/Settlements/TO BE FLESHED/Vergrenzig]]’s free-market ideals clashing against the strict theocratic rule of [[Concordat of Chains|The Concordat]].

#### 3rd Era: The Rise of the Concordat (Religious Takeover, 2021)

- [[Concordat of Chains|The Concordat of Chains]], a powerful group of [[The Lord]]’s clergy, arrived and seized control of Gellhafn, proclaiming the mist a divine trial to test mortal will.
- Under their rule, Gellhafn was renamed Hellhaven, a "bastion of order in a world of chaos."
- The great edicts were established: law, obedience, and industry above all else.

#### 4th Era: The Era of Iron and Chains (Present Day)

- Hellhaven is at a crossroads, torn between its theocratic law and the technological advancements reshaping society.
- [[Concordat of Chains|The Concordat]] fears losing control over the population as innovation challenges their monopoly on power.
- The Wraithmire Quarter’s mist has begun to shift unpredictably, with reports of strange figures emerging from its depths—an omen of past forces stirring once more…
### Landmarks
- **[[Locations/Landmarks/Establishments/The Bastion of Judgment]]** – A towering, fortress-like structure where criminals are sentenced and divine law is upheld. Public trials are held in the Forum of Redress before being carried out here.
- **[[Locations/Landmarks/Establishments/The Codexorium]]** – A grand, heavily fortified archive where [[The Lord]]’s decrees are recorded. Some say the deepest vaults contain knowledge of [[The Lord]]’s true origins, though access is near impossible.
- **The Gallows of the Weighing Night** – Located in the Tribunal Forum, this raised platform is where heretics and criminals are "weighed" and judged beyond redemption.

## Climate
Hellhaven sits along the **[[Locations/Regions/Windbor Coast]]**, a cold, wind-lashed fjord known for harsh storms and sudden changes in temperature. The sea is treacherous, with jagged cliffs and unpredictable currents making it difficult for unskilled sailors to navigate safely.
