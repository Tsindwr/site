## Historical Figures

>[!danger]- (Historical Figure Name)

> [!danger]- **Harven Norrick** *(fl. 1960s)*
> A former pirate captain who rose to prominence after the Mist Veil disaster, Harven Norrick was instrumental in organizing the The Free Enclaves of Istrecce. His initial involvement in [[Locations/Settlements/Haven of Hale/Hellhaven]]'s early mercantile agreements saw him broker several under-the-table deals with the clergy, providing essential supplies during the city’s rebuild. Norrick’s fortunes changed after a failed attempt to seize power during a factional civil war. His escape into the outer gulf marked the beginning of his infamous pirate career. Though labeled a traitor by the clergy, Norrick’s name is still whispered in the taverns of [[Locations/Settlements/Haven of Hale/Hellhaven]] as a symbol of rebellion and freedom.
