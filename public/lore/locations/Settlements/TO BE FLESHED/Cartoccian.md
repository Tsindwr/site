### Overview

>[!important]+ Description
>Located in the fallen ruins of a draconic city from the Age of Arcanum, this mountain-road outpost in the [[Drakonspyre Mountain]] range is filled with all sorts of refugees from the law and ne're-do-wells. there is definitely a thieves guild. The leader is the person who last stole a coveted [[Gnosichron|Gnosichronian]] artifact. Thus, the leader changes often in a city of thieves and conniving merchants. Because of the nature of its populace, the city has outlawed the mapping of the layout to safeguard the residents, and has become known as The Uncharted City. However, these two verdicts are the only legislation limiting its residents, leaving them to their own desires.
