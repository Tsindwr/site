> Formed after a meteor struck one of the moons, sending a chunk down to the surface. A gulf formed in the crater of this chunk of moon. Leaving deposits of [[Petrolune]] in the bottom of the ocean. It has been harnessed for thousands of years by aquatic life. But recently has been scraped by [[Locations/Settlements/Haven of Hale/Hellhaven]] to help build their city.
