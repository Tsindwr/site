# Sunder's Vision Statement

Sunder was created with the intent to give TTRPG players a storytelling framework that accommodates for creative choice. In this system, tasteful storytelling is rewarded in a quantifiable manner, and there are little to no limits to the kind of character you can play. Ease of use has been prioritized to cultivate a storytelling space that needs not be hindered by rules when unnecessary. This system encourages players to lean into their strengths, giving a natural blueprint for how to roleplay their character. Anything should be possible in Sunder, as long as a player is willing to pay the price to the story or to Magick itself.
