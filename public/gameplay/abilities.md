# Character Abilities and Stats

Abilities are the ways in which a player can translate narrative intent into mechanical effect. Abilities can come as **[[Actions]]**, **[[scenes|Surges]]**, and **[[scenes|Traits]]**. [[Actions]] are how players interact with the world and other creatures around them. [[scenes|Surges]] are minute effects that only affect the user, but can be activated at any time. [[scenes|Traits]] are constant effects that may affect a character's Stats, or provide specific triggers for [[scenes|reactions]] to be taken during gameplay.

Stats are a group of numbers made to define the base values of a creature. Stats are often referenced by Abilities, and can influence the power of Abilities activated by a certain creature. Examples of Stats include but are not limited to: [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] Scores, [[spellcasting|Spell Limits]], [[damage|Marks]], Archetype [[leveling|Levels]], and [[Proficiencies]].
## Laying Your Cards On The Table

With Abilities come Ability Cards, which give a player their options during gameplay and combat. Both Action Cards and Surge Cards are held upright or vertically, whereas Trait Cards are displayed horizontally. This allows players to organize their Hand in any way they wish, and have all of their options displayed in front of them.
### Action Cards

In Sunder, [[Actions]] come in two parts: an **[[actions|Attack]]** and a **[[actions|Movement]]**[^1]. When creating new Actions, one side of the Action card is the Focus. A **Focus** will be defined and purchased using the Experience Market, and its cost defines the budget for its Flipside. A **Flipside** is whichever part of an Action is not its **Focus**, so if an Action is built primarily around its [[actions|Attack]], then that Action's Flipside is its [[actions|Movement]].

The budget for purchasing the Flipside of an Action Card is calculated by *half* of the cost of its Focus (rounded down). Once a player has purchased a Focus, they need not spend any more [[Experience]] on its Flipside, as the budget is a complementary amount of [[Experience]] to spend on that Ability.
### Surge Cards

[[scenes|Surges]] come as simple descriptions on one side of a card, and can be flipped over facedown to show when a player has taken a Surge between [[scenes|turns]] or not. **Surge Cards** are activated at any time during combat, but are limited to once per turn, which is defined as the time between two [[Actions]] of a player character. Once a Surge Card has been activated on a turn, a player cannot activate another Surge Card until they have played another turn, as defined by playing two Action Cards at once ([[actions|Attack]] and [[actions|Movement]]).
### Trait Cards

**Trait Cards** are displayed as horizontal cards that stay faceup throughout gameplay. These [[scenes|Traits]] are the constant affects and capabilities of a creature, and can either improve the Stats of a creature, or give them an opportunity for [[scenes|reactions]]. 

[[scenes|Reactions]] defined in a Trait are given a defined Trigger, which determines when a player may activate that reaction. There is no limit to the number of times a reaction can be activated, but oftentimes they are bound be certain Caveats (see below) to reduce the cost of such an Ability.
### Taking Your Turn

There are a few status tracking activities that need to be kept in mind when in a scene or combat that requires tracking the reset conditions of turn-based Abilities. 

- Before taking your turn, remove any of your own Cards from play that had a duration of 1 turn.
- After taking a turn, be sure to return any flipped Surge Cards form the previous round back to faceup.
- [[countdown-dice|Sequence Abilities]]' dice should be incremented after every use.

## The Experience Market

Creating new Abilities in Sunder should be a simple task, so a pricing system has been provided for all aspects of an Ability. Each dimension of the "anatomy" of Abilities has been given varying levels of cost depending on the desired effect. 

When creating an Ability, always assume a mechanical effect needs to be purchased before it can be used. Some parts of the Ability anatomy are purposefully vague to allow for more creative, narrative-based effects. If you are unsure how to create an intended Ability, always ask your Game Master for assistance.

>[!note] Rule of Too Cool For School
>If you want a quick rule for using this system, decide on an [[Experience]] budget, then describe to your GM what you want your Ability to do or present as during gameplay. Your GM will be able to give you options for a finished Ability so you don't have to deal with the math. Just don't ask them to do so mid-session.

### General Abilities

 <div class="domain"><p>Redirect (P/P)<span class="subtext"> - Trait</span></p></div>
**Cost: 5 Strings** (1 Enhancement)
The Redirect Ability allows characters to move incoming [[stress-and-fallout|Stress]] from one [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] to another. To do so, the character must make a reaction when receiving incoming [[stress-and-fallout|Stress]] against the first designated [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]].

 <div class="domain"><p>Dexterity<span class="subtext"> - Trait</span></p></div>
**Cost: 3 Strings** (1 Enhancement)
The Dexterity Ability allows a character to use their Finesse [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] instead of their Might [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] when making [[resolution-system|Tests]] with melee [[equipment|weapons]]. This does not apply to any weapon with the [[equipment|Heavy]] or [[equipment|Unwieldy]] properties. *This ability can be assigned a prerequisite of any of the following [[archetypes]], reducing its cost by 2 [[experience|Strings]]:* Saboteur, Frontliner, or Summoner.

 <div class="domain"><p>Discipline Pool<span class="subtext"> - Stat</span></p></div>
**Cost: 6 Strings** (1 Enhancement)
When taking this Ability, choose one of your current [[Archetypes]]: this is your prerequisite. Create a name for your *Discipline* (e.g. Chi, Psionics, Vis, etc.). You have a number of *Discipline* Points (a special kind of [[potentials-and-resistance|Resistance]]) equal to your level in the chosen prerequisite Archetype. You may now create Abilities that expend *Discipline* Points instead of Resistances, but still have the discount to cost of spending a [[potentials-and-resistance|Resistance]] (-1 String) and having a prerequisite (-2 [[experience|Strings]]). Your number of *Discipline* Points is considered a permanent Stat.

<div class="domain"><p>Upgrade<span class="subtext"> - Stat</span></p></div>
**Cost: 5 Strings**
Taking an Upgrade allows a character to increment one of the following Stats by 1: +1 Mark, +1 to a [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] Score, +1 Knack, +1 Domain, +1 to a Discipline Pool's total Points, +1 to the number of uses for a Short or [[resting|Long Rest]] Ability, +1 to the Prepared Spell Limit, or +1 to the Total Enhancement Limit.

<div class="domain"><p>Driven<span class="subtext"> - Stat</span></p></div>
**Base Cost: 1 String** (1 Enhancement)
Purchasing new [[experience|Goals]] allows a character to have new sources of [[Experience]] Points, but these [[experience|Goals]] must have a narrative connection to your character's story. Purchasing this ability allows you make further purchases to unlock new [[experience|goals]]:

| Goal        | Cost (Strings) |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Minor Goal  | 1              |
| Flaw        | 2              |
| Major Goal  | 3              |
| Heroic Goal | 10             |

<div class="domain"><p>Companion (P)<span class="subtext"> - Trait</span></p></div>
**Cost: 5 Strings** (1 Enhancements)
Purchasing a Companion allows characters to give mechanical purpose to an existing pet, summon, or animal companion. When purchasing this Ability, choose a [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] to represent your bond with this Companion. Companions granted by this Trait are able to contribute in the following ways:
- *Aid*: Grant you [[resolution-system|Advantage]] on a Test while within Here. 
- *Buffer*: Once per scene, as a reaction to you being subject to an external effect that applies [[stress-and-fallout|Stress]], you may reduce it by a roll of your chosen [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]]'s [[volatility-and-perks|Volatility Die]]. 
- *Connect*: The bond between you and your Companion allows you to understand each other even if you do not share a language. You may also use a Surge to perceive through your Companion's senses. While perceiving in this way, you are insensate to your own body's senses.

You may give this Ability a prerequisite of the [[archetypes|Summoner]] archetype (-2 [[experience|Strings]]).

### Anatomy of Custom Abilities

When building a custom Ability, consider what primary effect you want to allow your character to do through this Ability (is it an attack, buff, heal, condition, or narrative effect?). Then, you can address what effects the Experience Cost of the Ability:

- **Activation Profile**: reset condition + action economy.
- **Effect Package**: damage, range, movement, targets, area, conditions, and durations.
- **Narrative Weight**: how much interpretive authority the Ability gives you.
- **Enhancements**: quantifying how much you can increase the capability of your custom ability
- **Caveats**: constraints that reduce cost.

---

## Enhancements

Some Abilities become much stronger when multiple parts combine (extra targets + range + conditions). To prevent multiplicative stacking from breaking the game, Abilities use a second limiter: Enhancements.

An Enhancement is a modifier you purchase for a specific Ability. Assigning certain powerful modifiers to an Ability consumes Enhancements. Your gameplay Tier[^2] limits how many Enhancements an Ability may have.
### Enhancement Limits

| Tier | Levels | Max Enhancements on one Ability | Total Enhancements per character |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| I    | 1–4    | 1                               | 2                                |
| II   | 5-8    | 2                               | 5                                |
| III  | 9-12   | 3                               | 8                                |
| IV   | 13-16  | 4                               | 12                               |
| V    | 17-20  | 5                               | 19                               |
Only Zenith-level Abilities can increase a character's Enhancement limits as a Stat increase.

### Buying Enhancements

Enhancements become more expensive the more you buy for a single Ability.

| Enhancement # | Cost (Strings) |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| 1st           | 2              |
| 2nd           | 3              |
| 3rd           | 5              |
| 4th           | 8              |
| 5th           | 13             |

### Conditional Enhancements

You can build an Ability with a real-time cost that expands the effect of the Ability after paying the cost.

- The Ability has a **Base Mode** (always usable) and an **Amplified Mode** (requires a cost upon activation).
- To activate the Amplified Mode, you may spend *1* *Resistance* in the relevant [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]].
- Adding to an Ability in this way still requires a player to spend the [[Experience]] for the modifiers used in the Amplified Mode, but does not require a new Enhancement to be purchased, nor does it count towards the maximum number of Enhancements. It does, however, count as an Enhancement in terms of prerequisites of a major modifier.

---

## Base Costs

### Reset Condition

An Ability's reset condition should by default be the same for each side of the Action Card, otherwise the player must pay the difference in their Flipside. If there is a difference in an Action Card's reset condition on either side, whichever reset period is longer takes precedence. Meaning, if you have a [[resting|Short Rest]] Attack and a General Movement you can use the [[actions|Movement]] side of the Action Card as much as you like, until you use the [[actions|Attack]] side, in which case you need to wait until a [[resting|Short Rest]] until you can use either side of the Action Card.

When altering the Reset Condition of the Flipside of a custom Ability, pay the difference in cost between the new Reset Condition and the already-purchased base Reset Condition.

| Reset Condition | Base Cost (Strings) |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Long Rest       | 1                   |
| Short Rest      | 2                   |
| Spell*          | 3                   |
| General         | 4                   |
\* Spells always come with a Consequence Caveat.

### Action Economy

| Activation | Strings | Enhancements |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Trait      | +1      | 1            |
| Surge\*    | 0       | 1            |
| Action     | 0       | 0            |
| 2 Actions  | -1      | 0            |
| 1 Minute   | -2      | 0            |
| Ritual     | -3      | 0            |
\* [[scenes|Surges]] can only target and affect Self.

## Effect Package Costs
### Damage

| Damage    | Strings | Enhancements |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Weapon    | 1       | 0            |
| Initial\* | 1       | 0            |
| +1dX      | +1      | 1            |
\* The initial amount of damage will always be the [[volatility-and-perks|Volatility Die]] that corresponds to the Test Skill's [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]]. If it is an AOE effect, it associates with either the [[Spellcasting]] [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] if it is a spell, or the primary [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] chosen when acquiring the Archetype this Ability is for. 

### Distances

In Sunder, distances are defined in intervals, which are well-translated to theatre-of-the-mind gameplay, but still preserve a specific measurement. If something is defined to have a distance, then it can affect anywhere up to the value correlated to the named interval. To select a target within range, you must be able to see or otherwise sense the target.

>[!info] Distance Interval Name
>- **Here**: 5 feet (adjacent)
>- **Near**: 10 feet
>- **Close**: 30 feet
>- **There**: 60 feet
>- **Far**: 120 feet
>- **Yonder**: >120 feet (Line of Sight)
#### Range

| Range  | Strings |
| ------ | ------- |
| Here   | 0       |
| Near   | +0.5    |
| Close  | +1      |
| There  | +1.5    |
| Far    | +2      |
| Yonder | +3      |

#### Movement

| Close    | +1     |
| There    | +2     |
| Far      | +3     |
| Yonder   | +5     |
If Movement is being added to an Attack Action, it requires an Enhancement slot. 

### Targets and Area

| Targeting            | Strings | Enhancements |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Single Target        | 0       | 0            |
| +1 Additional Target | +1      | 1            |

| AOE or multiple  | +5     | 2            |

### Temporary Increases
Increase your stat by 1 for the Ability's duration.

| Stat                   | Cost      |
| ---------------------- | --------- |
| Mark                   | 2 Strings |
| Potential              | 2 Strings |
| Proficiency            | 1 String  |
| 1 Test's Success Level | 5 Beats   |

| Recover    | String |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Stress     | 1      |
| Resistance | 2      |
| Condition  | 2      |

| Clear                   | String | Enhancements |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Potential's Stress      | 2      | 0            |
| Potential's Resistances | 4      | 1            |


---
## Narrative Effect

Applying a Narrative Effect to an Ability is required when you are looking for a specific effect that is not represented within the Sunder rule system. The magnitude of this effect will be determined by its Narrative Weight:

1. Aesthetic $\rightarrow$ Visual/sensational effects, utility effect up to a Here-sized sphere in Here range.
2. Utility $\rightarrow$ Minor magickal effects, can be physical, up to a Near-sized sphere in Close range.
3. Interpretable $\rightarrow$ Represents an affinity or attunement to a specific topic, no range constraints.

| Narrative Weight | Cost         | Enhancements |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Aesthetic        | +1 Beat      | 0            |
| Utility          | +1 String    | 0            |
| Interpretable    | +3-7 Strings | 1            |

---
## Ability Durations

Durations are priced by how long they remain active. Durations can either refer to how long a modification to a creature's Stats is active, it is measured in time. If the effect of the Ability is being activated several times to alter the effect of another Ability, then it is measured in Sequence Dice.

>[!important] Sequence Experience
>Sequence Tracks allow for opportunities to increase a player's [[Experience]] pool through gaining [[experience|Beats]]. The length of a Sequence Track is determined by the maximum value on the Sequence Die. This Track can be decreased in length in exchange for marking one of the Sequence Nodes on the Track as an [[Experience]] Node. When a player expends a use of a Sequence Ability whose current slot was an Experience Slot before expenditure, the player gains a Beat (e.g. if a D4 Sequence Ability which has been decreased to 3 Nodes, and the Experience Node was assigned to the 2nd slot, once the player activates the Ability for the second time, they gain a Beat).
>
>Assigning Experience Slots by default starts as the midway point on the track, rounded down (e.g. length 3 -> 2nd slot, length 4 -> 2nd slot). Increasing the number of Experience Slots changes the position of the original Slots, to spread out the slots as evenly as possible, keeping the 1st slot empty of Experience (e.g. length 5 & 2 Experience -> 2nd and 4th slots, length 4 & 2 Experience -> 2nd and 4th slots). The maximum amount of Experience Slots is equal to half of the Sequence length, rounded down, unless the Reset Condition is a Long Rest.

#### Durations

| Duration                  | Strings | Enhancement | Notes                                                                      |

\* Concentration means the effect ends if you take [[stress-and-fallout|Fallout]] that causes a [[stress-and-fallout|Stress]] refresh, or if you willingly drop it. You may spend a [[potentials-and-resistance|Resistance]] point in the relevant [[potentials-and-resistance|Potential]] to maintain concentration after [[stress-and-fallout|Fallout]].

## Companion Abilities

Upgrading the capability of your bond with your Companion gives them more ways to support you during your adventuring.

| Modification   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Strings | Enhancements |

## Caveats

Caveats reduce cost by making an Ability narrower, riskier, or more mechanically-bound.

### String-Level Caveats

| Constraint                   | Strings |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| Narrow trigger               | -1      |
| Narrative consequence        | -1      |
| Strictly narrative ability   | -1      |
| Severe narrative consequence | -2      |
| Mechanical consequence       | -2      |
| Spend Resistance             | -1      |
| Prerequisite                 | -2      |
\* Prerequisites can be Abilities, Archetype [[leveling|Levels]], or [[Origin]] choices. Each prerequisite can only be used 2 times (ex. you need to choose a new prerequisite after using an Archetype twice, such as choosing one of the previous Abilities as a prerequisite that used the Archetype as a prerequisite). Combining prerequisites counts as 1 distinct prerequisite.

### Beat-Level Caveats

| Constraint         | Beats |
| ------------------ | ----- |
| Test required\*    | -5    |
| Increase Riskiness | -5    |
| One use per scene  | -5    |
| Spend Stress       | -5    |
\* Requiring a test is baked into some Ability types like Attacks and Spells, so making a Test Required can only reduce cost when it's not necessary. Likewise, increasing [[resolution-system|Riskiness]] on a Test to activate the Ability can only be applied when there is a Test required, either by default or through the purchased Caveat.

### Spell Consequences

Spells must always have a Consequence. If the Consequence is more severe, it reduces the purchase cost more.

| Consequence       | Cost Reduction |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Narrative Fallout | -1 Beat        |
| Minor Fallout     | -5 Beats       |
| Major Fallout     | -2 Strings     |
| Severe Fallout    | -5 Strings     |

## Enhancement-Costing Modifiers

If you're not sure whether something should cost an Enhancement, ask: **does this multiply my impact per turn?**

Enhancement-costing modifiers usually include:
- +1 additional target
- any AOE
- a second attack in one Action
- major conditions
- damage beyond the first damage die
- interpretable narrative weight
- free movement baked into an attack
- changing an Action into a Surge or Trait
