# Initiative

In Sunder, initiative order is loose, responsive, and adaptable to player action. The GM decides who starts the initiative order, often based on actions and events leading up to the instance of combat. Initiative can be started due to combat or an intense moment requiring timing. Either one is called a scene.

Generally, adversary turns happen in response to player turns, this balances combatant action while also maintaining a reactive and cohesive narrative.

Players should "throw in the gauntlet" when they have something to contribute to combat. This can be represented by a physical token presented at the table, raising a hand, or claiming a spot in a queue. Typically, this would go on a first-come first-serve basis, with GM [[actions]] in between. However, players are free to withhold their turn in favor of another player that would otherwise be going after them.

Players may coordinate to make group actions. A group action must be combined effort to a single goal. While this circumvents the need to take adversary actions between each participating member's turns, it restricts their action to one focus. Players should describe how they contribute and make a Group Test.
## Actions

Generally, a turn consists of two actions: [[actions|Movement]] and [[actions|Attack]]. These can occur in either order but once the next action is taken, one cannot go back to an incomplete action and continue it. This encourages strategic decisions when choosing actions on a turn.
### Movement and Attack

When a character gains a new ability, either during character creation or by using the class feature market, they can receive an **Action Card**. These [[abilities|Action Cards]] are what define the character's options during combat. Each [[abilities|Action Card]] has two sides: an "[[actions|Attack]]" side on the top and a "[[actions|Movement]]" side on the bottom. During a player's turn, they play two cards. They must choose the top (or "[[actions|Attack]]") side of one card, and the bottom (or "[[actions|Movement]]") side of the other. During one's turn, a player cannot use the opposite side of the same card they have already chosen one side for, and they cannot choose the same side on both cards. 

A [[actions|Movement]] Action does not need to be restricted to literal movement. A [[actions|Movement]] action could contain a buff that lasts for a certain amount of usages, it could allow for a small secondary weapon strike, or it could involve a defensive effect that lasts the round. The same goes for [[actions|Attack]] [[Actions]]: Attacks need not specifically be a direct assault against a target creature. They can involve healing targeting an ally, or the activation of a large area of effect ability that lasts for a given duration. These are meant to be interpreted and follow the flavor of a given [[abilities|Action Card]]'s title, where the [[actions|Attack]] half is a direct approach and the [[actions|Movement]] half is indirect.
### Default Actions

Every creature is given a deck of default [[abilities|Action Cards]] that are accessible to everyone. Some class features may alter these base cards or replace them, but otherwise one player's default [[abilities|Action Cards]] do not differ from another player's.
### Surges and Traits

There are two types of [[abilities]] that can be activated outside of a player's turn, at any time during combat: **Surges** and **Traits**. 

A **Surge** is akin to a bonus action; it can only be taken once per turn, but is restricted in who it can effect. What gives a **Surge** its speed and ease is its cutting out of a third party. **Surges** often only affect its user or its user's possessions. Since there is no target to successfully hit or opposing force to overcome, **Surges** do not require a **Test** to be activated, and have a low or otherwise discreet impact to other creatures during combat. This means that a player can activate a **Surge** by tracking their "per turn" status, and notifying one of their neighbors at the play table. It is common to track **Surges** by tossing in a token to the center of the table or flipping a coin in front of the player, then resetting after they finish their next turn. This establishes credibility as to when the **Surge** was activated, as well as definition as to when another **Surge** can be activated.

A **Trait** is akin to a passive ability or a reaction; it defines an additional feature about the player's character and provides them with special actions that can be taken under specific circumstances. **Traits** can increase any stat on a player's character sheet, or alter it in ways fitting the mechanics of Sunder. They can also provide definitions of specific circumstances (e.g. "when an ally within **Close** range is targeted with an attack dealing physical damage") where the **Trait**-bearing character can take an action outside of their turn (e.g. "take a point of [[stress-and-fallout|Stress]] in Wit to switch places with the targeted ally and become the new target of the attack"). There is no limit to how often these special actions can be taken, just know that special actions like these will always come with a small, repeatable cost. 

When a creature activates a **Trait** in response to its defined circumstances, it is called taking a Reaction.
