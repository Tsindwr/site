# Resting

Rests represent a period of downtime and recuperation for our weary adventurers. Players may take time to roleplay during these time, possibly earning [[tokens|Flavor Tokens]] in the process. 

## Short Rests

**Short Rests** call for 4 hours of in-world downtime where characters can perform light activity but must not be expending resources such as Resistances or [[stress-and-fallout|Stress]] in order to benefit from the benefits of Rest Actions. During a Short Rest, a character may take 2 Rest Actions. Rest Action options are listed below. Some class features may give additional options for Rest Actions.
### Rest Actions

- **Relief**: Clear 1 [[potentials-and-resistance|Stress Track]].
- **Recover**: Regain a number of Resistances equal to a roll of your Nerve or Heart [[volatility-and-perks|Volatility Die]].
- **Heal**: Regain a number of [[damage|Marks]] equal to your Tier.
- **Repair**: Make [[resolution-system|Tests]] to restore damaged [[equipment]]. Requires a relevant Knack or weapon [[proficiencies|proficiency]].
- **Craft**: Use a tool Knack to create a small item or contribute to a larger piece (Test required).
- **Train**: Revisit a specific Knack [[proficiencies|proficiency]] to gain [[resolution-system|Advantage]] on checks using that Knack until your next Short or Long Rest.
- **Learn**: Spend [[Experience]] Points to purchase [[volatility-and-perks|Perks]].
- **Watch**: Keep watch over the campsite.
- **Preparing**: Narrate how your character spends the time preparing themselves for events to come. Gain 1 Beat, or if multiple characters are preparing together, each gains 2 [[experience|Beats]].

## Long Rests

Long Rests allow for most character resources to be replenished and statuses to be refreshed, and involve 10 hours of resting, 2 of which can be spent doing light activity, such as a Rest Action. 

During a Long Rest, players can spend any amount of [[Experience]] Points on [[Abilities]] from the [[abilities|Experience Market]].

[[damage|Marks]] can also be recovered during a Long Rest, but only a portion. [[damage|Marks]] are representations of the wounds that cut deep during adventuring, and those take time to heal. Choose Nerve or Heart: whichever your current Tier is, roll that number of the associated [[volatility-and-perks|Volatility Die]] and regain a number of [[damage|Marks]] equal to that total.
